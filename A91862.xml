Hotchkiss, about their applications (or mis-applications rather) of several texts of Scripture (tending cheifly) to prove that the afflictions of the godly are proper punishments. Unto which are prefixed two dissertations; the one against Mr. Baxter's dangerous problems and positions, about the immanent acts of Gods knowledge and will, as if any of those could be said (without blasphemy) to begin in God, in time, and not to be eternal as himself is: or, as if God could be said (without derogation to His infinite perfections) to begin to know and will in time, any thing which He did not know and will before, yea from all eternity: the other, both against Mr. Baxter and Mr. Hotchkiss, about their definition of pardon and remission of sins, in opposition to great Doctor Twisse's definition of pardon, as it is in God from all eternity towards his elect in Christ. / By William Robertson, Mr. of Arts from the University of Edenburgh.</title>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout five or ſix years ago, I did ſee a Book, bearing for its title, [<hi>Aphoriſms of Juſtification;</hi>] and for its Author, the name of [<hi>Richard Baxter, Paſtor of the Church at Kederminſter, &amp;c.</hi>] I had it but then lent me for ſo ſhort a time, (being but from one evening to the next) that I could ſcarcely have the opportunity to run over the Heads of it: yet as much as I could, I did (cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily) peruſe it, to inform my ſelf of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof; becauſe I was always deſirous to take notice of all Tractates tending to the clearing up of that ſubject: And although I never had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:120067:6"/>
to ſee the Book it ſelf again to this very hour, (although I have often deſired, and enquired for it) yet it hath many times ſince occaſioned the reflexion of my thoughts upon thoſe notions which I did then (though but confuſedly) apprehend, by that curſory reading of it; and it hath often cauſed thoſe expreſſions from me to others, which I do now here freely (as I cannot but always with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom open my very thoughts, whenſoever I reſolve to put them in words) beſpeak to your ſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> That I did conceive, that if the Author of that book were in any high eſtimation amongſt the Miniſtery in <hi>England,</hi> (as I judged by the rational Learning in that book, he could not but be;) and if he did live to proſecute the defence of the Principles therein propounded, that that Book with the Author of it in the defence of thoſe Principles, would prove the leading guides to the greateſt or moſt dangerous Sects of diſciples and followers, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been troubled with in all theſe times of confuſion. For I do always apprehend, that Jeſuitical, Arminian, and Socinian principles, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally and ſcholaſtically diſputed and defended by a (reputed) learned and pious Miniſter, are (in the concomitants and conſequents at leaſt) much more dangerous to the Church, then the worſt of the blaſphemous deluſions of <hi>Familiſts, Ranters, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe the deluded and phantaſtical ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of thoſe Wretches, are but as flaſhes of ſmoak from the bottomleſs pit, which though they may darken much and over-cloud the face of the Church for a ſeaſon, (eſpecially in the hour and power of darkneſs and confuſion) yet the leaſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:120067:6"/>
glimpſe of the Sun of Righteouſneſs his ſhining truth breaking through thoſe clouds, will preſently diſpel and ſcatter them, ſo that all their authors and abettors ſhall be aſhamed of them: But thoſe other Principles, being (ſeemingly) backed with much of Reaſon and Learning, are (chiefly) dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the perverting from the truth the more knowing ſort of Chriſtians, who ſeldom uſe to be led aſide to blaſpheme with mad and deluded dreamers.</p>
               <p>Theſe may ſeem hard thoughts, and tart reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon that Book and the Author thereof. But, Sir, I have already told you, that I cannot but freely beſpeak my thoughts, if I ſpeak any thing at all: And the great ſtir that that little Book hath made in the world, ſince it was publiſhed, (it being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſliked with a diſreliſhing prejudice, by moſt of the learned Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and yet in my thoughts too too many others highly admiring it, or at leaſt too highly eſteeming you and your principles in its defence;) and the greater it is likely yet to make, if you continue to proſecute the defence of it, and the conſequences from it, which you have ſince owned and publiſhed, doth make me now again freely, and publikely, (which I dared not to do before, becauſe you had but in that Book darkly and ambiguouſly, me thought, expreſſed your ſelf in ſome points which you do now profeſſedly own,) to impart unto you, that I do now conceive and apprehend, that my former thoughts and apprehenſions of that Book and its Author, were not altogether (as I could gladly wiſh they were) miſconceptions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:120067:7"/>
and miſconſtructions of your Tenets.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>I had long ago ſeen (as I have already declared) your <hi>Aphoriſms of Juſtification;</hi> and about a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth ago, I did ſee Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> (at leaſt in his endeavour) rationally refuting them: But I never had leiſure to read over all his book, only at ſome ſpare hours to view ſome parcels of it; and I could not therefore ſatisfactorily to others, nor with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to my ſelf, either judge of your Work, nor of his; becauſe I had never ſeen ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in that your book of Aphoriſms, a little more plainly explicated by your ſelf, and owned more profeſſedly then you do there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Only thus much I muſt freely ſay, that I do verily think that there is much more in Mr. <hi>Crandon's</hi> Works then you have as yet let the World know that you have taken notice of: and that (ſetting aſide that which may be termed bitter railing, and revi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For about that time of your ſo frequent preaching in many of the chief Auditories in the City, I was one evening with two Scholars and Preachers, whom I did hear ſpeak of your <hi>Apologie</hi> for your <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms;</hi> and upon the occaſion of their diſcourſe about ſome points in that Apologie of yours, and becauſe of my own former thoughts about your book of <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> I was very deſirous to peruſe it, having never had the opportunity of peruſing it before. And therefore the next morning I made enquiry for it, and had the ſight of it; which when I had got, I did immediately fall to a curſory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of it, being confident you would in it explicate your mind more clearly, in ſome things delivered very ambiguouſly, as I thought, in your Aphoriſms; and indeed I found it ſo: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

the firſt part of your Apologie to Mr. <hi>Black,</hi> I was very much taken with ſo much of a profound, deep and rational judgment, with ſuch a clear and ſolid underſtanding, and with ſo great a height of a piercing wit, as I did apprehend in ſome of your reaſonings and explications of ſome points by you holden forth there: yet in the afternoon, I was forced to pitch my thoughts for ſome time upon that exclamation, <gap reason="foreign">

For turning over, for my afternoons work, to your Apologie againſt Mr. <hi>Kendal;</hi> me thought you looked upon me there with quite another countenance, the very glances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did ſo much affright me, when either I looked upon it, or when it ſtared me in the face, that I do profeſs I could not behold it, nor ſo much as think upon it, without trembling averſation. A ſudden change, you will ſay, and yet no more ſtrange then true; at leaſt I am ſure that I did apprehend ſuch a change in your countenance, and that I did feel ſuch a change wrought thereby in my breaſt, that although I had ſet, before-noon, your accurate ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120067:8"/>
in ſome of your diſputing diſcourſes upon one of the higheſt ſeats of my affection and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; yet in the afternoon, I never did abhor with greater deteſtation &amp; indignation the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of any man, and the defence of them, then I did that one moſt blaſphemous (I muſt crave permiſſion from you ſo to ſtile it, becauſe that is the beſt title I can give it in my thoughts, and therefore I can give it no better in words; ſo that I muſt ſay again, I never read of any Principle, in any mans writing, and the defence thereof, with greater indignation and deteſtation, then I did that moſt horrid) Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of yours, and your defence of it, about the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent acts of God, in his Knowledg and Will:</hi> as if they (or any thing immanent in God) were, or could be, <hi>de novo,</hi> ariſing or beginning to be in him in time, and not from all eternity; as if there could be any thing in God, which is not God himſelf, and eternal as himſelf is.</p>
               <p>This, this I ſay, Sir, is that Monſter of your mind, which did, and doth ſo much amaze me, that I ſhall be loath hereafter ſo ſuddenly to think ſo much, or eſteem ſo highly of any man, as knowing (experimentally from you) that he may be ſo far left to himſelf, and to his own underſtanding, as that he may like the goat, with his foot in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, caſt down and ſpurn over all the good milk hath been given all the day; and by his ſelf-willed affection biaſſing his judgment, to defend his own principles, or to make good his own expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in oppoſition to others, he may ſtrain his wit to the utmoſt, to maintain contradictory Tenets, not only to truth made known by divine revelation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:120067:9"/>
but even to truths that are evident of themſelves by the very light of rational nature, or natural reaſon.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Sir, when I do think upon all the Opinions that your Antagoniſts do challenge you with, and do endeavour to faſten upon you, ſetting aſide this, and the conſequents of it, and although you ſhould profeſſedly own and maintain them all, they would not all of them taken together, beſides this, ſo much have ſtumbled and offended me, nor would they ſo much have cauſed the publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording of this my abhorring deteſtation of your defence of them, as this one doth; becauſe I do think that all the Errors that are laid to your door, though taken <hi>in cumulo,</hi> and bound in a bundle or bulk together, are not ſo heinouſly derogatory from the glorious Majeſty of God, nor do they all of them ſo much blaſpheme his name in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfections, as this doth, in its ſelf and in its conſequences. That is, that although one ſhould openly maintain, that Faith is not the inſtrumental cauſe of our Juſtification; and that we are juſtified by ſome works, as Repentance, Hope, and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as by Faith; and that we were ſaved by ſome of our Works as well as by Faith; and that our works were meritorious of eternal life, by Gods appointment and Chriſts merit: and that the afflictions of the Godly were real (and properly ſo called) puniſhments; and that Chriſt hath redeemed all the World univerſally by the price of his blood, (though that were indeed a ſad ſaying, and moſt irrational, to ſay, that our Lord did pay the price of no leſs then his blood and death
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:120067:9"/>
for thoſe, for whom he ſaith himſelf he did not ſo much as pray unto his Father; and although that one ſhould deny the final perſeverance of all the truly godly, as conceiving that ſome might be ſuch, and yet not peremptorily elected to ſalvation: I ſay, although theſe be dangerous Tenets indeed, yet if one ſhould maintain all of them, and many ſuch like Popiſh and Arminian errors, yet I could not abhor the defence of any one or all of them, ſo much as I do abhor and deteſt this one of yours, Sir, (if it could be ſevered from them, and they from it) to wit, in that you do frame to your ſelf (and would endeavour to impoſe upon others the horrid fiction of) a God like (in imperfections) unto frail and miſerable man, in the actings of his Knowledge and Will; by maintaining God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to know in time, that which he did not know from all eternity; and to begin to will in time, that which he did not will from all eternity; and that in time he doth begin to love in Chriſt, thoſe whom he did not love in Chriſt from all eternity; yea, that he loves to day whom he did hate yeſterday, and loves to day whom he may hate to morrow; nay further, that he may reprobate or hate to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoſe whom he hath predeſtinated; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate or love to ſalvation, thoſe whom he hath reprobated: For ſo the famous, or rather moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous patronizers of your Tenets do hold and maintain in thoſe very words which you do cite and tranſcribe from them, to ſhew that you are not ſingular in thoſe monſtrous opinions of yours and theirs; and which words and Tenets you do not in particular diſown when you tranſcribe them.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:120067:10"/>
And whether thoſe be Tenets beſeeming an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Miniſter in the Reformed Proteſtant Church, or an eminent Divine in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let any Orthodox Chriſtian judge; and whether theſe be not your Tenets, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly by you maintained, or quoted and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from the worſt of Blaſphemers, in their expreſs words, and not diſowned by you, for the defence of your own poſitive Tenets, let any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Reader peruſe your diſpute againſt Mr. <hi>Kendal</hi> about the <hi>immanent acts of God,</hi> and judge. Laſtly, let the meer rational light of natural reaſon it ſelf be judge, whether thoſe Scriptures be not evident truths, which are plainly contradictory to thoſe before-mentioned blaſphemous and accurſed errors: As when it is ſaid, that, <hi>Known anto the Lord are all his works,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Whether rational light doth not clearly and immediately aſſent to the truths deduced from hence, that if we acknowledg God to be God, that is, infinite in all perfections; we muſt acknowledg that there is no begining nor ending, nor no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, change, nor variation, no futurition, nor prete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition in the acts of his Knowledge or Will, nor in any thing that is in himſelf; nothing more or leſs in the perfection of his Knowledge, or in any of

                  </gap> and eternal in all his perfections? Whereas you do not ſtick, Sir, poſitively and (<hi>expreſſis verbis</hi>) plainly to affirm, that when God doth know a thing in its preſent exiſtence, he doth then begin to know more of it, then he did know before of it from eternity: And what is that but to put a <hi>more,</hi> and a <hi>leſs,</hi> in the knowledge of God, and ſo to deprive it of infinite, eternal, immutable, and unchangeable perfection; and to reduce the increated and infinitely perfect knowledge of God, unto the infirmities and imperfections of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated knowledge in humane underſtandings? As if that becauſe ſuch worms as we know things far more perfectly when we behold them before us with our eyes in their real exiſtence, then when we contemplate them as future and afar off, as it were, to come; therefore the infinite and unchangeable knowledge of God muſt be ſubjected to the ſame imperfection, infirmity, and frailty of knowledge. Whereas the very light of nature evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrateth this, that the infinite knowledge of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Deity, muſt neceſſarily know (as the Scripture <hi>Pſ.</hi> 139. 2. ſpeaks of our thoughts, ſo) all things knowable, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>merachok,</hi> afar off, even ſo far off as from all eternity; and that as fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, becauſe every way infinitely, as he doth know them when they do really exiſt, and are known ſo to be unto us: Elſe, as it is often ſaid, and as is clearly evident to natural light, he were not unchangeably, eternally, and infinitely perfect in his knowledge of things, and ſo he were not God, if he were capable of the leaſt imperfection. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:120067:11"/>
what is a more, or a leſs (though) in (the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of) knowledge, but an imperfect knowledge, or an imperfection of knowledge? a more in (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of) knowledge, neceſſarily inferring a leſs in (the ſame perfection of) knowledge; and a leſs perfect knowledge, being a little imperfect knowledge. Which to affirm to have been only in God from all eternity, of things future and to come, until their preſent real exiſtence in themſelves, and that then he begins to know more of them then he did before; which you do expreſly, Sir: How fearful an apprehenſion and expreſſion is it, and how deſtructively repugnant to his infinite and moſt perfect way of knowledg of things! For it doth moſt groſly ſuppoſe, that there is ſomewhat in God like to our organical eyes, whereby he doth (as we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect worms do) look out at windows, as it were, without himſelf, to behold ſomewhat of things in themſelves, and in their real exiſtence, which he did not ſo perfectly behold before that real exiſtence of theirs in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Which is ſo groſs and craſsly abſurd an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the moſt pure and moſt ſimple Deity, that even the light of natnre abhorreth it; to which it is clearly evident, that God knoweth all things infinitely, by nothing elſe that our reaſon can reach rational thoughts of, but his own moſt pure and moſt ſimple eſſence, which doth as (<hi>perfectiſſima rerum omnium idaea</hi>) the moſt perfect <hi>idaea</hi> of all things, repreſent all things knowable unto himſelf, <hi>uno eodem perfectiſſimo &amp; ſimpliciſſimo actu,</hi> by one and the ſame moſt perfect, moſt pure, and moſt ſimple act; and that <hi>uno &amp; eodem ſimpliciſſimo &amp;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:120067:11"/>
perfectiſſimo cognitionis modo,</hi> by one &amp; the ſelf-ſame moſt pure, moſt ſimple, and moſt perfect manner or way of knowledge; and that from all, and unto all eternity, before, in, and after all worlds. (Elſe how could he be rationally conceived unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and immutable in himſelf and in his infinite perfections, if he did know things by divers and different ways of knowledge; as one way from all eternity in himſelf, by his own eſſence, for then there was nothing elſe to know things by; and another way in time, by the things themſelves and their real exiſtence?) Which is clearly conſonant alſo to the Scripture-expreſſion before cited from <hi>Peter:</hi> For the proportion mentioned there of a thouſand years with the Lord as one day, and of one day with him as a thouſand years; doth hold of ten thouſand mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of years with him as one hour, and one hour with him as ten thouſand millions of years: yea, ten hundred thouſand millions of years are with him and his knowledge, as one minute; and one minute or momentany inſtant, with him and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite knowledge, as ten hundred thouſand millions of years; the ſame proportion holding <hi>in infinitum.</hi> So that all time imaginable, with him and his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledge, is nothing but his infinite eternity; comprehending all the differences of time, paſt, preſent, and to come, and all things falling out therein by one eternal way, and infinitely perfect act of his knowledge; which he had from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, hath now, and into all eternity, not by any thing without himſelf, or by any organical eye looking as it were out at a window, to behold things without himſelf, and to ſee them as they are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:120067:12"/>
in themſelves and in their real exiſtence; for ſuch an imperfect way of knowledge, he hath given to created and finite underſtandings. But as he did from all eternity, ſo doth he now at this very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and unto all eternity, ſee, know, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, by one and the ſame moſt perfect and infinite way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to wit, not from or by any thing without himſelf, or diſtinct from himſelf, as finite and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated underſtandings do; but in himſelf, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his moſt pure and moſt ſimple uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded eſſence; or in and by the infinite repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of all things knowable, in that his moſt ſimple and uncompounded eſſence, which is the moſt perfect <hi>idaea</hi> or exemplary form of them all. Thus he did underſtand and know things done this day, a thouſand years agone; for both thoſe (to wit a thouſand years, and one day, yea ten hundred thouſand years, and one hour or the minute of an hour) are one to him and his infinite knowledge: yea, this day he underſtandeth, and did from all eternity underſtand and know all things future for all thouſands of years to come, thus, and no other way, then by the infinite and moſt perfect repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of things in his eſſence. For if there were different ways of knowledge in God, he were not without all variation and ſhadow of turning, and ſo would not be the immutable and unchangeable God. Which alſo would neceſſarily be inferred, if there were or could be any new immanent acts or act of Gods knowledge, which were ariſing and beginning <hi>de novo,</hi> and in time: For then he would nor, nor could not be the ſame knowing God he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:120067:12"/>
was before and from all eternity, becauſe he did begin to know what he did not know before and from all eternity; as you boldly dare aver he doth, about the preſent and real exiſtence of things.</p>
               <p>What are your tergiverſations, your ſubtile eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſophiſtical arguments againſt the Truth, and for the defence of your moſt dangerous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this point, I do profeſs I would gladly take freedom here to meet with, and to deſcant a little about them. But when I do look back to my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I do ſee I have blotted already above a ſheet and a half in one afternoons writing, about that which I did intend but to be the ſubject of ſome few proemial lines, and but introductory to the chiefly intended matter of this Epiſtle. I ſhall therefore endeavour to be the more brief in that which followeth, and in the body of the Epiſtle it ſelf, when I ſhall come at it. Only thus much briefly I would ſay unto you further, That the ſame and much more the like grounds might be inſiſted upon, to manifeſt the like irrationality of your Tenets, about the immanent acts of Gods will alſo, which you dare likewiſe denominate to begin in time, and ſo to ariſe <hi>de novo</hi> in God, which were not before; and that he beginneth to will the preſent exiſtence of things, when they do exiſt, which he did not will before; and that he beginneth to have in his will new acts of approbation, love and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of a man, when he doth well, and ſo doth begin to love whom he did hate before, changing the acts of hatred unto the acts of love and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: As likewiſe you affirm that there do begin
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:120067:13"/>
and ariſe <hi>de novo,</hi> or in time, new acts in his will, of diſlike, diſapprobation, and hatred, when he doth evil. And hence you frequently, but blaſphemouſly ſpeak of the acts of Gods will about things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf, as preſuppoſing their objects to be exiſtent, before theſe acts of the will of God were elicite, or did begin to be terminated upon thoſe objects.</p>
               <p>Alas, Sir, if a rational <hi>Turk</hi> or Heathen, who did but acknowledge an infinite, immutable, and eternal Deity, did hear ſuch poſitions; how would he abhor the Religion of thoſe who acknowledge ſuch Principles? and how would he exclaim againſt ſuch blaſphemous conceptions, as do apprehend the immutable will of God, in his own acts, to change from one contrary affection to another; and as do conceive the eternal will of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe any objects (beſides himſelf) or any real entities, in any conſideration unto the acts thereof, as exiſtent before them; ſince that, in the acts thereof, is the abſolute and univerſal cauſe of the exiſtence of all objects and real entities beſides himſelf; and how can any of thoſe acts then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe their objects? How would not, far rather, the clear light of rational nature aſſent to theſe truths, becauſe evidently clear of themſelves, and by their own light, to all who do acknowledge an infinite and immutatable Deity? As when that immutable Deity ſhould ſpeak thus of himſelf; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:120067:13"/>
ſuch principles as do make God, in time, another knowing God, and another willing God, then he was from eternity, by beginning, in the acts of his Knowledg and Will, ariſing in him <hi>de novo</hi> and in time, to know and will what he did not know and will before, and to begin to love thoſe whom he did hate before. And how would not the light of nature ſubſcribe to the truth, if God ſhould ſpeak of every one whom in time he loveth, thus: <gap reason="foreign">

Will not the light of nature, of it ſelf, ſubſcribe to thoſe truths, and abhor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary errors?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:120067:14"/>And as for your ſo frequently and inſnaringly bringing about the queſtion at every turn, to Gods knowing and willing the preſent exiſtence of things when they do exiſt, which he did not know nor will before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth not the ſame rational light of nature clearly dictate and aſſent to the contrary, to wit, that God from all eternity did both will and know all things future, as fully and perfectly as ever he doth afterwards into all eternity? For there are no greater or leſſer imperfections in the Knowledg and Will of God; elſe there were imperfections in himſelf, and ſo he were an imperfect God: But from all eternity God did will the preſent exiſtence of every thing (that was future) to be for ſuch a time. And hence it follows, that every ſuch thing is future, till that before-willed time come; preſent or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and really exiſtent, ſo long as that before and eternally willed time doth continue; and paſt for ever, after that that before and eternally willed time is paſt. This is but one moſt ſimple and moſt ſingle uncompounded act of Gods will; inferring the thing neceſſarily to be future ſo long as it is future, preſent ſo long as it is preſent, and paſt when once it is paſt: But it is a moſt fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and a moſt irrational and abſurd concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to conceive and imagine divers new ſucceſſive acts of Gods will about ſuch objects; as one act for them as future, ſo long as they are future; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other new act (ſucceeding the former) about their real exiſtence whilſt they are preſent; and another new act about their preterition, when they are paſt. Whereas common light doth dictate to us, that all thoſe are but one ſingle act of God, willing and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:120067:14"/>
determining that ſuch a thing ſhall be exiſtent for ſuch a time, which maketh ſuch a thing future for ſuch a time, (or future from all eternity, till ſuch a time of its real exiſtence,) preſent for ſuch a time; (during the continuance of its real exiſtence,) and paſt for ever, after that determined time of its real exiſtence is once ended.</p>
               <p>And theſe are alſo the clear dictates of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal light, about the acts of Gods Knowledg: For it is moſt irrational to conceive, that God doth firſt know things to be future by one act of his knowledg; and then when when they begin to exiſt, that he ſhould begin, by a new ſucceſſive act to the former, to know that they do exiſt; and that afterwards, when the time of their exiſtence is at an end, that he ſhould begin by another new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive act of his knowledg, to know that they are paſt: But by one moſt perfect, moſt pure, moſt ſimple, moſt ſingle and uncompounded act of his infinite knowledg, from all eternity he knoweth (becauſe he willeth) ſuch a thing to be exiſtent for ſuch a time; which is, from all eternity, to know it future for ſuch a time, preſent for ſuch a time, and ever paſt afterwards; and that all with one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually perfect and infinite act of knowledg, having neither more nor leſs of perfection of knowledg in it, but altogether the ſame and alike, from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in time, and unto all ternity; and that not by any thing without, beſides, or diſtinct from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but in and by his own infinite, moſt ſimple, and moſt pure eſſence, and by the moſt perfect repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of all things therein, as was before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:120067:15"/>Thus did God know all things from all eternity, and before all worlds: And thus we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity acknowledg that then he did know things only ſo, that is, in himſelf, and by his own eſſence, and the repreſentation of things therein. For, from eternity, there was nothing without, beſides, and diſtinct from himſelf and his own eſſence, to know things by, ſo that then there could be no looking out without himſelf, to ſee and to know things in themſelves; becauſe they were not then in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſeen and known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of them by his own eſſence. Yea, thus alſo muſt we (if we will not blaſpheme, by attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting imperfection to an infinite Deity, if we fear to do ſo, I ſay, we muſt) acknowledg that now in time, and unto all eternity, God doth know things now exiſtent, paſt, or to be exiſtent, not by any thing without, beſides, or diſtinct from himſelf, as the <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> the formal reaſon of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; for this were, and could not be, but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect way and manner of knowledg, for God to look out, as it were, without himſelf, to know groſs corporeal things exiſtent in themſelves, by any ſpecies, or by any repreſentation of, from, or by themſelves, but only by that ſame infinite, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, eternal, and moſt perfect repreſentation of all things in his own eſſence, (that being the moſt abſolutely perfect manner and way of knowledg, not needing or lacking any thing from without, no not the things themſelves, to know them by) and that as perfectly, and infinitely more perfectly in every particular conſideration of things, then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they could be known in themſelves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:120067:15"/>
himſelf, by looking out upon them as they are in themſelves, and without his own eſſence, and the infinite moſt perfect repreſentation of them therein.</p>
               <p>Thus he did from all eternity know things, (for there was then no other thing but himſelf to know things by;) and thus therefore muſt we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that now in time, and unto all eternity, he doth know all things. Elſe how could it be avoided, but that there would be an imperfect change in God, in his knowledg, or in his way or manner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if from all eternity he did know things only in himſelf, and if in time he did begin to look out and know things without himſelf, and in themſelves. But our God is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who changeth not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 34. And <hi>with him is no variableneſs nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have put down my diſſenting thoughts from your Tenets about theſe points, in a number of confuſed lines, without any premeditated order or method obſerved or taken notice of in them, but as faſt put upon the paper as they did come into my mind, or could fall from my pen in ſo many hours writing as are in two afternoons, which I did moſtly ſpend in writing thus far. So that there is only to be looked for in them the ſubſtance of my preſent and extemporary conceptions, without any ſtudy of accuracie, form, or method. For, the firſt afternoon that I did begin to write in, I did intend nothing here about this queſtion, but briefly to let you know (in a page, or two at moſt, as then I thought) my publike diſſent from thoſe your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120067:16"/>
Opinions, (which I could not but do, if I wrote any thing publikely in reference to you, or any of your followers) and how much I did diſlike them; referring to a larger intended Diſſertation the more full and large oppoſing of theſe Opinions in a more methodical Diſpute againſt them. But no ſooner did I fall upon thoſe Tenets which I ſo much abhor, then I did find that I could not draw my thoughts to ſo narrow a compaſs in paper, as I had both reſolved and deſired to do. Always, Sir, if you ſhall be pleaſed to take notice of the matter, in any ways as you think fit your ſelf, not regarding or looking too much to formalities, (which I never did, nor can endeavour much to do) you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to take notice of what you ſhall pleaſe to communicate and impart unto me, in any way that you ſhall approve of, or think moſt convenient: Providing, that a mutual freedom be not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; and that ſilence be not imperiouſly expected or commanded, if ſatisfaction be not given, and diſſatisfaction removed and taken away.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as for that particular which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this Miſſive doth mainly point at, and which I did mainly intend at this time in theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtolary lines, I could willingly give you an account of it, of my thoughts about it, and the occaſion of it. But firſt, becauſe I fear that I have wearied you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with my tediouſneſs in the Proem to it; and ſecondly, becauſe another of your Friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, together with your ſelf, is concerned into it: I ſhall therefore crave your permiſſion to let me breathe a little, and refreſh my ſelf, in changing the perſon to whom, as well as the ſubject matter

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome few days ago, a Friend of mine (and a high Eſteemer of a Friend and Patron of yours) one morning told me, that he had ſeen a Book bearing your name, about <hi>Remiſsion of Sin, and the Nature thereof;</hi> with Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Patrocinie prefixed to it. I cannot but much eſteem of that learned man, and moſt judicious Divine, in ſo far as I have rational grounds ſo to do; even as far as he doth evidence himſelf to be indeed what you do ſtile him, that is, one <hi>Eagle-ey'd</hi> in Rational diſputations. Thus far I do go hand in hand along with you in eſtimation of him, (but no further.) And therefore I could not chuſe but be deſirous to know and be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one (I mean you Sir) whom ſo great a man doth ſend abroad into the world under his tuition and patronizing recommendation; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120067:18"/>
and expreſſing ſo my ſelf unto my Friend that told me of it, that it could not be without ſome ſpecial reaſon and deſerving conſideration, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did perceive afterwards my ſuſpition failed me not, when I did all along through your whole Tractate, in tracing of your ſteps, obſerve his large foot.)</p>
               <p>I did therefore preſently, with my friend, go to the Bookſellers ſhops, to ſee if I could find you out, and ſo have the opportunity of my ſo much deſired acquaintance with you, for your Friend and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons ſake, whom I do ſo much reſpect. There in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did find you, but could not leave you, till I did bring you home to my Chamber, to the end I might be the more familiarly intimate with you. I ſpent moſt of the hours following ten a clock of that day, firſt in hearing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> preface his recommendation of you, and his good-liking ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of your Tenets and opinions; (and no marvel, thought I to my ſelf, becauſe I ſuſpected, as I afterwards in the progreſs did find, all, or moſt of them to be his own.) And then in hearing you ſpeakfully your own mind, from the beginning to the end of your diſcourſe. Upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I hope common equity will require at your hands, that I may be alſo taken notice of, and heard a little, in giving you now an account, what then were ſome of my thoughts and obſervations, in going along with you in your elaborate Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and which I could not have leiſure to put in paper to acquaint you with, till now about eight or ten days after my firſt hearing of you.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I would preface thus much, That
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120067:18"/>
I do not intend at this time, and in this Miſſive, to give you my Judgment about all the points by you diſputed in that Diſſertation of yours; That, Sir, could not be done conveniently in an Epiſtle; But there are chiefly two things that I deſire to acquaint you freely with my thoughts about them. The one I purpoſe to inſiſt a little upon, as being at firſt my chief intended ſcope and purpoſe, to ſignifie to you (and to your great Friend) by theſe, what were my thoughts about it; and therefore I ſhall leave it to the ſecond place. The other I will but mention, and touch in as few lines as I can, and it is this: I would intreat you not to be offended, that I do verily ſuppoſe your whole Book, in the chief intent and ſcope of the whole Exercitation therein contained, to be notoriouſly peccant and halting, in that known Fallacie called <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> taking <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and quite miſtaking or wilfully miſconſtruing your Antagoniſts mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in your diſputing againſt him. I give this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the whole bulk of the Book, becauſe the miſtake lieth in the very <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, as it is cleared and explained in reference to the chief ſcope and purport thereof. A ſharp cenſure it may be, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, looked upon and conſtrued: But, Sir, let me make out my reaſon to others, which makes it out thus much, and nothing leſs to me; and then let indifferent and unprejudiced arbitrators judg of it. My reaſon of ſuch a cenſure is this, Sir. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your Book is the Explication of the Nature of Forgiveneſs or Remiſſion of Sin, in an Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereabout; chiefly tending, as I conceive, to refute and diſapprove (and ſo to beat down that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120067:19"/>
ſo much ſtartled at, and conceived to be the grand pillar of Antinomianiſm, to wit) Remiſſion or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of all the ſins of the Elect, <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> from all eternity. And hereupon you take upon you to deal with that (truly ſo reputed) great <hi>Malleus,</hi> and indeed the grand hewer down of all Jeſuitical and Arminian principles, root and branch; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively with whom, I do not ever think to ſee any one, or all of ſuch his Antagoniſts, worthy to be named in one and the ſame year; He being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to be ſet aſide by himſelf, at leaſt in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all his Adverſaries. as the (truly ſo reputed and ſtiled) <hi>Flos illibatus Ingeniorum Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, Sir, upon the forementioned account, you take that noble and victorious Champion of the Grace of God (againſt all the blaſphemous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers thereof) the great Doctor <hi>William Twiſs,</hi> whoſe very name in the mouth of any that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his principles, is enough to hammer down all Jeſuitized and Arminianized Theologaſters, and to beat them from all they dare oppoſe him in: Him, I ſay, you do take to oppoſe you (indeed methinks a moſt <hi>impar congreſſus Achilli</hi>) and to be your Antagoniſt and Adverſary in your Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about remiſsion of ſin: Whereas either he is nothing at all ſuch, that is, your adverſary, in ſo far as there is truth in your conceptions about that point; or elſe if he be your Antagoniſt at all, it is but onely in ſo far as you your ſelf are an Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt to Truth it ſelf in that point; and to that which nill ye, or will ye, you muſt acknowledg to be truth, if you have either ſenſe, reaſon, or any fundamental
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120067:19"/>
principles of the orthodox reformed faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion left in you. I ſay again, that the learned Doctor is either not your Adverſary at all, as you do fallaciouſly and ſophiſtically beſpeak him to be; or elſe only in ſo far as you are adverſary to the truth, about the nature of remiſsion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if the Doctor be a real Antagoniſt to you and your Patron, in your notions about the nature of forgiveneſs and remiſsion of ſin; then he muſt either deny, that remiſsion of ſin is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of the obligation to puniſhment by the law of Grace, which is the ſo much decantated and Eagle-eyed <hi>Baxterian</hi> definition of remiſsion of ſin; or elſe he muſt deny that remiſsion of ſin is the ſuſpending or the effectual taking away the puniſhment it ſelf in the real execution thereof, which is the ſo much cry'd up <hi>Hothckiſſian</hi> definition of remiſsion of ſin, (<hi>Hotchkis</hi> in this being ſharper in ſight, and more accurate, it ſeems, then the Eagle himſelf.) But if ever Doctor <hi>Twiſs</hi> did deny either of thoſe notions ſo far as there is any truth in them, or if any of his words inferring a denial of theſe truths, ſo far as they are truths, can be produced by any of his Antagoniſts, (although I have not looked upon any of his Works this four or five years by-gone, but one half day only, when I had an occaſion to turn over his Volumes about an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other queſtion, not ſo much as minding, becauſe having never ſo much as heard, of this to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed againſt him by you; yet if any ſuch thing can be found in him, as that he averreth that the taking away of the puniſhment of ſin, together
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120067:20"/>
with the diſſolving the obligation to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, cannot be called remiſsion or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin) then I ſhall be content to be whipt as a School boy by Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> my maſter, when ever he ſhall teach and ſhew me ſo much out of the Doctors own words and writings. Nay, upon the contrary, his very words which you cite and quote here out of him, do clearly infer the conceſsion of both the forementioned definitions, ſo far as there is any truth in them. For what is <hi>Negatio punitionis,</hi> the <hi>denial, or the negation and denying of puniſhment,</hi> which in the very words you tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe out of him, as againſt you, he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to belong to the nature and formal reaſon or <hi>quiddity</hi> of remiſsion of ſin: What is it, I ſay, but either the delaying, ſuſpending, or taking away in whole or in part, the puniſhment due unto ſin? And is not this the very nature and remiſsion of ſin, even in your ſo accurate (and more then eagle-ey'd) definition it ſelf thereof? And if ſo how doth then Doctor <hi>Twiſs</hi> contradict you, or you contradict him, when both of you agree in the very quiddity it ſelf, or in the very nature of remiſsion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin? Have you not had an eager and ſharp'ned ſpirit of contradicting <hi>Twiſs,</hi> when you make a contradiction, where there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you?</p>
               <p>Again, ſhall ever any rational man imagine, (that ever hath look'd upon and underſtood but a page of the Doctors moſt accurate writings) and think that the moſt Rational Doctor was ignorant of this, That the diſſolving of the obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw of Grace, when the condition

thereof is fulfilled, may be called a legal remiſsion and forgiveneſs of ſin, or remiſsion and forgiveneſs of ſin in a Law-ſenſe, or by the Law?</p>
               <p>As I muſt acknowledg, I could not but with much indignation read ſo often from the pen of your Eagle-eyed Patron, the learned Doctor to be ſo much upbraided and reproached with ignorance of this point; ſo I do verily profeſs, I rather believe, that as he ſaith of himſelf, that he hath had moſt of his Scholaſtical learning, ſo he hath had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Notion alſo from the famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors writings: I ſay, I rather believe this, ſay what he will to the contrary, then that I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve either him or you, though both of you ſhould ſcandalize the Doctor, by affirming a thouſand times, and upbraiding him (now when he is dead and gone, and ſo cannot anſwer for himſelf by word of mouth) to be ignorant of this point, ſo clearly revealed in Scripture?</p>
               <p>What? did ever the moſt Orthodox Doctor deny, that <hi>being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord?</hi> and that <hi>there is no condemnation</hi> (of the Law, of the Devil, of Sin. or of any other thing) <hi>to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> and that <hi>the Law of grace and faith in Chriſt hath freed us from the law of ſin, death, and damnation?</hi> Did ever, I ſay, the moſt Rational and Scriptural Doctor deny thoſe, and many ſuch other like Scriptural Doctor deny thoſe, and many ſuch other like Scriptural truths? or rather did he not ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly, by great ſtrength and light given him from above, maintain them againſt all biaſphemous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of theſe truths, and ſuch like? And what are thoſe truths, but this in ſubſtance, that by faith in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:120067:21"/>
Chriſt we have remiſſion of ſins; that is, by the new law of Grace, (the condition thereof, to wit Faith in Chriſt, being wrought in us by the Spirit) we are legally, and in a Law-ſenſe, diſſolved from the obligation to the puniſhment of death, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and due unto us by the law of Works? And nothing of all this, I think, not any that ever was taught or catechiſed underſtandingly in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, will deny: And I am ſure the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor defended them, to the ſmart of all Jeſuites and Arminians, to his very dying day; and his writings, after his death, will do the ſame ſo long (I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident) as there is either Jeſuite or Arminian upon earth; till all the monſters of their luxuriant brains be ſo daſhed and cruſhed into peeces, as that there ſhall not ſo much as a remnant of them be heard of in the Church?</p>
               <p>How then is the learned Dr. feigned by you and your imperiouſly dictating Patron, to be ignorant of thoſe truths, and of that your ſo much extolled explication of them? As if that the Doctor had been ſo much taken up with the doctrine about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, (as indeed he was ſo taken up with thoſe myſterious truths, as that I hope his labours, next unto the Scripture, ſhall be mainly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to effectuate all and more then is ſaid in the foregoing lines, about the extirpating and utter eradicating all Jeſuitical and Arminian principles, which have for ſo long a time infeſted the peace of the Church: Yet I ſay, it is a greater reproach to thoſe who upbraid him with it, then to himſelf, becauſe it is a notoriouſly known ſlander, to ſay that the Doctor was ſo much taken up about the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:120067:21"/>
Decrees of God,) as that he was ignorant of this truth, That by the law of faith, of grace, and Chriſt, we are freed in time from the law of ſin, death, and damnation, and ſo diſſolved from the obligation-to puniſhment, threatned and due unto us thereby. And what is that, but that lagally, or in ſenſe of Law, our ſins are forgiven us, when that obligation to puniſhment is ſo diſſolved by the law of Grace, and through faith?</p>
               <p>How could then the ſharp-witted Doctor be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the diſſolution, or freedom from the obligation to puniſhment, might be legally, or in ſenſe of law called remiſſion and forgiveneſs of ſin? Or where did ever the Doctor wilfully (for I am ſure he never did it ignorantly or miſtakingly, as being ignorant of it; it being a point ſo clear of it ſelf, for ſo far as is truth in it, as that not only the Doctor, but who is there any elſe that is rational, and can) deny it? Nay, he never did deny it at all. The Eagle is therefore too ſharp and piercing, not only ſeeing that moſt brightly which others do ſee but dimly, but ſeeing that which is impoſſible to be ſeen, becauſe it is not at all; as Doctor <hi>Twiſſe's</hi> ignorance, denial, or contradiction of this truth, (ſo far as it is a truth) is a meer non-entity, that cannot be ſeen by all the Eagle-eyed ones in the world. But I rather think that Eagle-eyes do ſometimes ſleep as well as others, and then I ſuppoſe they ſee no more then others; yet then perhaps the fancy or imagination even of Eagle-eyed ones may dream of non-entities, and feign to themſelves and their own imaginations meer Chimera's.</p>
               <p>But ſay you, Sir, that the Doctor doth not only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:120067:22"/>
ſay, that <hi>negatio punitionis, the negation of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> may be called remiſſion of ſin; but alſo that <hi>negatio volitionis puniendi, the negation of the will, or the denial in the act of the will to puniſh,</hi> (that is, the purpoſe and reſolution of the will, or a willing not to puniſh) may alſo be called remiſsion of ſin, and that the nature of forgiveneſs may be ſaid therein to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>And I anſwer, Sir, 1. Yet that doth not infer that either he doth contradict you, or that he doth deny what ye affirm about the point: For, ſay you, the nature of remiſsion of ſin conſiſteth in the take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the puniſhment it ſelf; ſo ſaith the Doctor, that the very quiddity of remiſsion of ſin is <hi>punitionis negatio,</hi> the denying of the puniſhment, or the denying to puniſh; and what is that but to take it away? How doth he then contradict you, when he affirmeth the very thing that you affirm? But 2. whereas he ſaith alſo, that remiſsion of ſin is <hi>negatio volitionis puniendi,</hi> the denial of the will to puniſh, or a will not to puniſh; yet this doth not infer that he contradicteth you, or denieth what you ſay, but rather that he affirmeth the ſame thing with you, and doth only add ſomwhat thereunto: which is not, I hope, to contradict or deny what you ſay. You affirm, that remiſsion of ſin is the taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf; the Doctor ſaith that remiſsion of ſin is indeed, or may be ſaid to be the negation or the taking away of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment it ſelf: (This is not to deny or contradict what you ſay, I am ſure, but to ſay the ſame with you.) But the Doctor ſaith alſo, (and I hope with more reaſon then you can oppugne it) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:120067:22"/>
of ſin is or may be ſaid (not only to be the negation of the puniſhment it ſelf, but alſo) to be the negation of the will to puniſh, or the act of the will determining not to puniſh: But he doth not ſay that remiſſion of ſin is only this act of the will not to puniſh. Therefore this is to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then you ſay indeed, but it is not to contradict or deny what you ſay, ſince he alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth and granteth it. Elſe when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith that remiſſion of ſin conſiſteth in the diſſolving of the obligation to puniſhment, and you acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſame, yet you do add to it ſomewhat more, and ſay that the negation or taking away of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment it ſelf, is alſo to be called remiſſion of ſin. Doth this contradict what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith? No, your ſelf do affirm that you do not contradict him in ſo ſaying. And whether doth the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict what either of you ſaith, becauſe he ſaith ſomewhat more (rationally) then both of you ſay?</p>
               <p>3. But further, Neither doth the Doctor ſay (in theſe words tranſcribed by you) poſitively, that the determination of the will not to puniſh, is formally remiſsion of ſin: But he ſaith only disjunctively, thus; <hi>The remiſſion of ſin, in the nature of it, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but either the negation of the puniſhment, or the negation of the will to puniſh.</hi> Leaving it fully free to you, which part of the disjunction to chooſe, and which you pleaſe you may like beſt without any contradiction of him to you, or of you to him, if you chooſe either of thoſe disjunctive parts. And where is then the Doctors contradiction of you, or his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying what you affirm?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:120067:23"/>But laſtly, Sir, what if the Doctor ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you by affirming indeed what you ſo much labour to diſprove in him? I ſay, that he then doth no more contradict you, then you do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the truth; and your contradiction of him, (even under all the great patrocinie and protection with which you conceive your ſelf ſecurely ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is nothing leſs then the contradiction of the truth it ſelf in this point which we do now inſiſt upon: Which that it may rationally be made out, let,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The queſtion be ſtated, Whether the will of God not to puniſh, be in it ſelf, and can be (ſo) properly called pardon, remiſſion, or forgiveneſs of ſin. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it be ſuppoſed and granted, that the Great <hi>Twiſs</hi> doth affirm, that <hi>Volitio non puniendi,</hi> or <hi>negatio volitionis puniendi in Deo;</hi> the will of God not to puniſh, may be properly called pardon, remiſsion, and forgiveneſs of ſin. And</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do you but come out into the field, and deny this truth which the Doctor affirmeth; as you do indeed in your Exercitation, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alſo doth labour much to diſprove it, by many ſeeming reaſons, or ſophiſtications rather, and by manifold abſurdities which you and he doth alleadge it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, &amp;c. Then</p>
               <p n="4">4 Notwithſtanding all thoſe terrors, yet under the ſhelter (of Truth, and) even of the famous Doctors <hi>umbra,</hi> though himſelf be gone from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; againſt you, and all the ſhelter you have or can expect from all his living Antagoniſts, if Scriptural reaſon may be Judge, I dare ſtand up
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:120067:23"/>
and affirm, <hi>That the determinate purpoſe of the will of God from all eternity, not to puniſh the ſins of his elect in Chriſt with eternal death, is properly mental pardon, remiſſion and forgiveneſs of ſin, in the breaſt of God;</hi> and may, yea ought, properly, and moſt properly to be ſo called. Yea, I do aver this to be ſuch a truth, and ſo clearly evident to Scriptural reaſon, that I do profeſs, that though all the Devils in hell, and all their erronious inſtruments on earth, were each and all of them turned into Angels of light, employing all their deluſions to oppoſe it, I would not fear the ſhaking of it: And I am eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to come into a formal, rational, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical diſpute with you about it, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, to ſhame and canvaſe all your ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications againſt it, and to retort all your abſurd conſequences, by manifeſting the abſurdity of all ſuch irrational illations. For I have looked over all your reaſonings againſt it again and again, either where Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or you purpoſely do diſpute againſt it, or where you touch and hint at it but the the by. And I do profefs I can give no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cenſure of them, but that each and all of them are either falſe and fallacious, or quite irrational, as being quite beſides and out of the way, and nothing at all againſt the preſent truth in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>And although I would be glad to particularize this cenſure, and make it good in each of them, yet I cannot have the opportuity to do it at this time, and it would be too much for an Epiſtle: Therefore I ſhall only here, as briefly as I can, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch an Explication of the preſent Truth, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120067:24"/>
that, in my apprehenſion, may make it evident of it ſelf to every rational conſideration of it:</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, I dare appeal to the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vulgar ſenſe and reaſon, about the truth of the point in general: <hi>Whether the purpoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the will not to puniſh delinquencies and faults, be not the real pardon, remiſsion, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe faults and delinquencies?</hi> Let any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal man retire himſelf, and look back with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting thoughts upon the actings of his own ſoul and the faculties thereof within himſelf; and let him conſider, if that whenſoever he had taken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte, or hatred and diſpleaſure againſt any perſon, by reaſon of any fault of commiſſion or omiſsion, or upon any conſideration whatſoever; and if it were in his hand to puniſh him, any manner of way which he pleaſed; let him conſider, I ſay, whether or not that all along the time that he did retain a purpoſe and reſolution in his will to puniſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, ſome way or another, the fault it ſelf and the perſon for the fault, was not unpardoned and unforgiven? But ſo ſoon as ever that either by an act of his free favor, or by ſome ſatisfaction offered or given, or upon any conſideration whatſoever, he hath laid aſide the purpoſe to puniſh the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and the delinquencie, and is ſo well pleaſed with him, that he doth take up a determinate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and purpoſe not to puniſh him; yea, he doth determine moreover, that at that time he ſhall think fit and moſt convenient, he will beſtow many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favors upon him, and keep him continually in favor with him; yea, never reſolve to caſt him quite out of his favor again: I ſay, let any ratinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120067:24"/>
reflect upon ſuch actings of the will in ſuch reſolutions and purpoſes as theſe, and let it be ſeriouſly thought upon, whether at the very paſsing of theſe favorable acts of the will towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, (though the delinquent know it not yet himſelf) both he himſelf and his faults be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; and whether the very paſsing of theſe acts of the will, that is, whether thoſe ſame favorable purpoſes and reſolutions of the will not to puniſh, but to beſtow ſo many favors, be not really the mental pardon, remiſsion, and forgiveneſs of the delinquent and his faults; and whether it may not, ought not, and muſt not properly, yea moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſo called and ſtiled, if we will call it any thing at all, to diſtinguiſh it from other acts of the will towards the ſame object? The truth is, I think it ſo clear, that I count him ſenſleſs, or wilfully ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, that dareth to deny it.</p>
               <p>Take another illuſtration of the point, thus: A King hath a number of his Subjects broken out in rebellion againſt him; let it be ſuppoſed that they are but mad in doing of it, and that he can take order with them and puniſh them when he will; yet he is pleaſed out of his free, abſolute, and royal favor, to decree, purpoſe, and reſolve within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not to puniſh thoſe Rebels, but in due time, at the interceſsion (and perhaps the ſatisfaction ſome way or other) of his Son or Favorite in their behalf, to bring them home to himſelf, and to prefer all and each of them to places of honor about himſelf, and never to degrade nor reject them out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, nor from their places of honor again; Is not this very decree not to puniſh, and to reſtore into
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:120067:25"/>
favor, real and mental pardon, remiſsion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of theſe Rebels and their rebellions, in the councel of the Kings own breaſt, heart, minde and will? and is it not properly to be called ſo? Will any, after this favorable decree of the Kings will, not to puniſh the Rebels, is paſt, be ſo irrational as to ſay, that the Rebels are not mentally pardoned in the Kings own breaſt, and in the cabinet-councel within his own heart? And what though none know of it but the Kings ſelf, yet is it a real pardon, though a ſecret one: And what though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels themſelves come not to know thoſe favorable acts of their Soveraigns will and pleaſure towards them for a long time after, as being perhaps a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles diſtant, or by ſome other impediment, or upon ſome political conſideration kept from hearing of it? yet is it notwithſtanding a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and really paſt in the Kings breaſt, though not knowingly to them. Yea laſtly, what though the full fruition of the Kings favor be ſuſpended to the Rebels for a time, and till ſuch or ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be performed by them; and that it be with ſuch a caution, that if after their reception into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor they fall into leſſer faults, they ſhall be chaſtiſed with leſſer ſtripes; yet all this doth not obſtruct the reality of their pardon and remiſsion, as to the main point of their lives: For he is fully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to puniſh them in that higheſt degree of puniſhment, ſo that they are fully pardoned as to that; and as for the condition of their enjoyment of his favour, if the King himſelf hath fully and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determined alſo to bring them effectually to the performance of it, what can be a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120067:25"/>
pardon, and a more compleat remiſſion then this? and who can deny it to be ſuch?</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, the application I leave to your ſelf, for it is obvious: For hath not the Lord from all eternity determined and decreed not to puniſh his elect in Chriſt, for their ſins, with eternal death? What is this decree and determination of the will of God, but the real pardon, remiſſion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of their ſins, ſecretly in the breaſt of God, although it be not known unto them? And what though the ſenſible enjoyment of Gods favor be ſuſpended for a ſeaſon, until the performance of a condition, which is Believing; yet hath not God purpoſed alſo to work and effectuate that faith in them, which is the condition? and doth not that make their pardon, in his breaſt, altogether abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute? And laſtly, what though he hath appointed alſo to correct them with the rods of men for their ſins; yet the pardon of their ſouls, for the main, that is, from eternal death, is ſure unto them, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abſolutely determined of God from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And therefore as to that, they are from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity pardoned, from all the ſins that they ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in time; becauſe from eternity he hath purpoſed in Chriſt not to puniſh their ſouls with eternal death.</p>
               <p>Now this is all that Dr <hi>Twiſs</hi> and all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines do mention about this point, when they do affirm that the ſins of the Elect are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned from eternity; <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath from eternity purpoſed and determined in his immutable will, not to puniſh his Elect with eternal death for their ſins, but to free them from it. And what is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120067:26"/>
pardon from eternal death, if it be not firſtly, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moſt properly, the determinate purpoſe of the will of God, not to puniſh with eternal death? I profeſs, Sir, I am almoſt aſhamed to uſe ſo many words in ſo clear a caſe. Who but your ſelf, and ſome few others from whom you have drunk in thoſe principles, will, or can deny that <hi>Pardon may be properly called the will, or the purpoſe of the will not to puniſh?</hi> And who elſe can deny, that <hi>the will not to puniſh, is really, and may be called properly pardon?</hi> Truly, methinks, the very firſt thoughts about the formal conceptions of thoſe words, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, Pardon, and Forgiveneſs, ſhould at the firſt inform any rational underſtanding, that they are moſt properly rational acts of rational and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculties; I mean, that they are rational or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable acts, proceeding from rational and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able agents; and that they are immanent acts, eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited out of the rational faculties of thoſe agents, I mean in their firſt, chief and moſt proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: For what is it to pardon, to remit, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but to reſolve not to exact the rigor of puniſhment, or to lay aſide the reſolution of exacting ſtrict puniſhment? As if you be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my rude informal way of writing, as you may think; and if it were in your hand to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me as you pleaſed; if I ſhould come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire pardon of you, and that ye would forgive me my offence, &amp;c. I profeſs I know nothing that I ſhould require or deſire of you in ſuch a ſuit, but that ye would freely and willingly be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve or determine not to puniſh me: I ſay, this is the firſt thing that I would require and deſire of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:120067:26"/>
you, that you would purpoſe not to puniſh me; and then if you were a man indeed, that is, conſtant in your reſolutions, I would really hope that the puniſhment effectually ſhould not be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me?</p>
               <p>So I ſay, that which I do conceive is the firſt and formal conception to be apprehended about theſe words, <hi>pardon, remiſsion,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> &amp;c. is the will not to puniſh. For, what is it that formally I mean, when I do ſay, I pardon, I remit, I forgive you, &amp;c. What is it, I ſay, that I mean by theſe words, but only this; I will not puniſh you, or I will not deal with you in the ſtrictneſs of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according as I could, and as ye deſerve? I ſay, this is the firſt formal apprehenſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of thoſe words, which is firſtly, primarily, and moſt properly meant by them; although after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, an inſtrument or a grant of pardon, and the act thereof, may be called pardon in a legal or in a law-ſenſe; as alſo the negation of, or ceſſation from puniſhment it ſelf, may be called executive pardon: Yet both thoſe preſuppoſing the firſt, chief and moſt proper pardon, which is mental in the breaſt, or in the purpoſe and reſolution of the will not to puniſh; from which flow all the other, as ſecondary, leſs proper, and more remote pardons, to him who pardoneth, at leaſt; and more improper pardons both to the pardoner, and to the pardoned.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Sir, I think this truth explained upon theſe grounds, is ſo clearly evident to the underſtanding of any rational conſideration, (even of a ruſtick or clowniſh apprehenſion) that, as I ſaid at the beginning, if you have any reaſonable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:120067:27"/>
ſenſe or underſtanding, you cannot deny it. And yet ſince the great ſcope of your whole Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to diſprove it; and ſeeing that your great <hi>Moecenas,</hi> at every turn whenſoever it comes in his way, doth labor as much alſo as in him lieth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; I ſhall add yet one proof more (and then I ſhall draw to an end) of the point, to clear the explication of it, both againſt you and him; and I think, will ye, or nill ye (both) it ſhall ſtrain an acknowledgment of the Truth in general, from you both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſay, Sir, that the will not to puniſh, is not pardon properly: why? becauſe you alleadge that the taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf is properly and formally the nature of pardon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, that the will not to puniſh, is not pardon; why? Becauſe (ſaith he) the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of the obligation to puniſhment by the law, is properly Pardon, and the nature of it.</p>
               <p n="3">But 3. I ſay againſt you both, that in neither of thoſe, the remiſſion and forgiveneſs of ſin, in its form and nature, doth ſo much and ſo properly conſiſt, as in the reſolute and determinate purpoſe of the will not to puniſh. And I prove it thus by one general Reaſon againſt you both.</p>
               <p>That which may ſeparated and really ſevered from the remiſsion, pardon and forgiveneſs of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencies, is not the nature of pardon and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp;c. <hi>(For I hope you'll acknowledg that the nature of a thing cannot be really ſevered nor ſeparated from it ſelf.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But both the real or effectual taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf, and the diſſolving of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120067:27"/>
to puniſhment by the law, may be really ſeparated and ſevered from pardon, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore in neither of them doth the nature of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don conſiſt.</p>
               <p>I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> firſt, againſt you Sir, (and your definition of Pardon, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf:) And that by ſuppoſing this caſe, which hath ſeveral times actually fallen out; to wit, Suppoſe a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent (or one reputed ſo) were ordained, appointed, and ſent to the place of execution, both by the law, and the will of the King; ſuppoſe in the mean time much interceſsion were made for his life, and that he offered to give reaſonable ſatisfaction for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or that perhaps ſome witneſs or evidence did come in which was not known of before, declaring and evincing him to be innocent of the offence laid to his charge; immediately both the King by his will, and the Law, or the Judges by the Law acquit and pardon him; and all haſte with diligence is uſed, and a meſſage is ſent to prevent the execution: But (alas for the poor mans caſe!) the meſſenger hath a great way to go perhaps, and the time may be ſhort he hath to go it in, ſo that though he make all the diligent haſte he can, before he is able to come at the place of execution, the hour appointed for it is come, and the execution is done. How doth this caſe, Sir, look upon your pardon? or how do you look upon it? Whether was this man pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or not? take notice how ye anſwer this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for you have more therein to contradict, then me, if you deny the pardon; for it is not onely I, that will affirm this man really pardoned, by the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:120067:28"/>
mental pardon in the Kings breſt, or by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his will: But your Eagle-eyed Patron will affirm it with me, That the man was really par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, becauſe the Law did diſſolve the Obligation to know him, as much as was in it to do; and you ſhall be (your eyes will hardly ſee beyond the Eagles, ſo that) you muſt not, you will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, (whatever you would do me;) nay you ſay your felf, you will not contradict him in his definition of pardon, to be the diſſolving of the obligation to puniſhment, in ſenſe of Law; onely you adde ſomewhat more to his definition, to wit, the effectual taking away of the puniſhment. But, Sir, ſay I, if you adde that, you muſt not adde it as the nature of pardon, and as the definition of pardon. For here the poor man had pardon, real pardon, yea, full pardon, (not onely in my eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in his eſtimation, whoſe opinion to you, is of more force then a hundred of my Reaſons;) and the puniſhment was not taken away, but the poor man is executed.</p>
               <p>I profeſs, Sir, I know not here, what rationally ye can anſwer; and I have put a ſtop for half an hour, to my writing, to think what ſhift you can poſſibly make for your ſelf; to evade, and have ſomewhat at leaſt to ſay, that you be not utterly ſilenced; and as yet nothing can come in my minde, which probably you can (be ſo irrational, as to) alleage, but this, That thus it is with mans pardon, or with pardon amongſt men; but it is not ſo with Gods pardon.</p>
               <p>But firſt, Sir, when we ſpeak of the nature, quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or eſſence of a thing, in the definition of it, I
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:120067:28"/>
think we ſhould take notice, that all definitions of any thing, ſhould be Univerſal, or univerſally agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thing defined, where-ever it is exiſtent, in every conſideration, and in every ſubject, where it is found; and that nothing ſhould be put as the nature or eſſence of a thing, but that which may (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) univerſally be affirmed of that thing, whereever it hath a Being. Now it is univerſally true, That where ever there is any real pardon, there is a will not to puniſh; whether we ſpeak of mans pardon, or of Gods.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, That if it be univerſally ſo in pardon, and remiſſion, or forgiveneſs with man, that his will, or purpoſe not to puniſh offenders, is really and properly to be called pardon; then any rational underſtanding will immediately infer, That if there be ſuch a will, or purpoſe, not to puniſh ſinners in God, then that will not to puniſh, is really, yea moſt really, and properly, yea moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, is to be called pardon in God: For if a will not to puniſh in man, be pardon, (as I do appeal to any man that hath either ſenſe or reaſon, and his wits about him, if it be not;) is not ſuch a will, not to puniſh if it be in God, pardon alſo? but ſuch a will is in God, from, and unto all eternity, not to puniſh the ſins of his Elect in Chriſt, with eternal death. Dare you deny this? Therefore there is in God, from all eternity, a proper pardon of his Elect for all there ſins, as to eternal death, becauſe he hath eternally purpoſed not to puniſh them with that; and therefore as to that puniſhment of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, they are eternally pardoned in the Breſt of God, (altho they cannot know it themſelves, till
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:120067:29"/>
they believe;) becauſe God hath eternally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his Breſt, or in the Counſel of his Will, not to inflict it upon them, notwithſtanding their deſert, or merit of it in time:</p>
               <p>But thirdly, Sir, the caſe may be ſo put home to you; as to beat you quite out of that ſubterfuge, and make you aſhamed of it; (not onely from Reaſon, which I conceive is done already, but) even from your own, and your Patrons Principles, the Argument holds good againſt your opinion, That the effectual taking away of the puniſhment, is not the proper nature and eſſence of pardon; becauſe they can, and may, nay really they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſevered, and ſeparated the one from the other, and that even in the pardon (not onely of man, but) of God, according to the <hi>Baxterian,</hi> and <hi>Hotchkiſſian</hi> principles; which I do make out thus. Let us but alter the former caſe a little, and ſee what it doth beſpeak unto us: Suppoſe a King ſent a Rebel, or a Traitor to the Gallows, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either by a free act of Grace, or upon ſome conſideration, or another; ſent a pardon after him, which did arive and come in time enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the execution, and was offered to the Traitor; but he ſtubbornly doth reject and refuſe it, and ſo is hanged; in this caſe, the man is really pardoned, and forgiven his Rebellion, both by King, State, and Law as the ſuppoſition may be made; and yet the puniſhment is not effectually taken away; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the nature of pardon doth not conſiſt in the effectual taking away of the puniſhment, for thoſe two may be ſevered.</p>
               <p>Now what will you deny here, Sir? I ſay in this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:120067:29"/>
caſe, firſt, the man was pardoned; will you deny that? yes perhaps, as it comes from me, you will: But what if it come from the mouth of him, that hath the Eagles eye in his head, to ſee and conſider well what he ſpeaks, that it be not amiſs? I hope you will not deny it then. Well then, if Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> be ſuch a one, as I am ſure he is in your account, theſe are his very words, <hi>If ſuch a pardon were brought to a Traitor at the Gallows, and he refuſe it, and be hanged, men would ſay, That the King or State did pardon ſuch a man, but he wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it.</hi> Now Sir, I hope you will not, you cannot in reaſon contradict the common ſaying of all men, eſpecially, when he with the Eagles eyes in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is amongſt them; and whom in this point you your ſelf affirm, you will not contradict. So then the man was pardoned by the conſent of all; you cannot deny that.</p>
               <p>But 2: I ſay, that notwithſtanding he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, yet his puniſhment was not taken away. Will you deny this? ſure not; for he was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and deſervedly too; for elſe it had been unjuſt murther, if they had killed him without a cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he deſired it. And therefore in this caſe, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and pardon ſeem rather to be all one, (for they go here both together, the man was pardoned and puniſhed both,) then pardon and the effectual taking away of the puniſhment: for theſe two are ſevered here; the man was pardoned, yet his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was not taken away, therefore both theſe cannot be one and the ſame thing; for, <hi>quae reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeparari poſſunt, realiter inter ſe diſtinguuntur &amp; differunt:</hi> Whatever things may or can be really
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120067:30"/>
ſeparated, thoſe things are really different the one from the other, and therefore the one of them cannot belong to the eſſence or definition of the other.</p>
               <p>What will be your evaſion in the caſe thus ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Sir? Perhaps it will be thought the ſame may be ſaid as before, That thus it may be in pardon amongſt men. No, the man with the Eagles eye hath prevented that: For it is to the pardon of God that he bringeth in and applieth the former caſe, in the words before quoted. And the ground of it is, Becauſe, according to his and your (<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi>) principles, as Chriſt by the price of his blood hath univerſally redeemed all men, ſo God by his law of grace and by his offer of ſalvation in Chriſt hath univerſally pardoned all men: And yet notwithſtanding that univerſal pardon, all the Reprobate (becauſe of their obſtinate final reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refuſing the grace and ſalvation offered therein by Chriſt) are eternally puniſhed. To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate which, he bringeth the caſe mentioned laſt in the words tranſcribed out of him:</p>
               <p>Now I will not make it my buſineſs here to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt that feigned univerſal redemption and pardon: I do only thereby argue with you for the preſent <hi>ad hominem,</hi> That according to your own principles you do moſt irrationally make the nature of pardon to conſiſt in the effectual taking away of the puniſhment; whereas many thouſands you do acknowledg to be pardoned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who yet nevertheleſs are eternally puniſhed. Therefore pardon, and the taking away of the puniſhment, cannot be all one, ſince they are ſeparated the one from the other in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120067:30"/>
many thouſands of reprobates, and therefore of neceſſity muſt be really different and diſtinguiſhed the one from the other.</p>
               <p>And thus much, Sir, for the <hi>Hotchkiſſian</hi> Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Pardon, (to wit, that it is the effectual taking away of the puniſhment) as it is brought in oppoſition to the <hi>Twiſsian,</hi> viz. That it is a will not to puniſh.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as to the <hi>Baxterian</hi> definition of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to wit, That it is the diſſolving of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment by the law, or in a law-ſenſe, as he and you do phraſifie it; I ſay the ſame againſt it, that I ſaid againſt yours, That it is not worthy to be named in the ſame day with the Doctors defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to expreſs the nature of pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in general: And that becauſe the Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition doth expreſs univerſally the nature of (the firſt, chief, and moſt properly called) Pardon, where-ever or in whomſoever it is found. For, where-ever there is any proper pardon, the firſt, chief, and moſt proper part and ſtep of it, is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the will not to puniſh: Where this is not, there is no proper pardon; and where this is, there is proper pardon. Where-ever there hath been any offence given, if the will of the party offended do once freely paſs from the reſolution to puniſh leſs or more the offence in the party offending, then is the offence and the offender pardoned, or then is that party offending fully pardoned and forgiven his offence: And in ſo far as the will paſſeth a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or reſolution not to puniſh, in ſo far is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence pardoned; and in ſo far as the will doth not reſolve to deſiſt from puniſhment, in ſo far the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:120067:31"/>
is not pardoned, not the delinquencie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. If the will not to puniſh be conditional, it is a conditional pardon; and if the will not to puniſh be abſolute, it is an abſolute pardon; and in a word, ſuch as the will is not to puniſh, ſuch is the pardon. And this ſheweth that this Definition expreſſeth the very nature of proper Pardon.</p>
               <p>The truth is, Sir, this is ſo clear and ſo evident in it ſelf, and from its own light, that it is an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me, that an Eagle-eyed one doth not ſee it. But compare we his Definition in oppoſition to this, and ſee if it be ſo fully quadrant to the nature of Pardon in general, and we ſhall find it nothing ſuch. <hi>Pardon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the diſſolving of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment</hi> by the Law. But ſay I, the ſame argument which overthrew your definition, will lay this low alſo; for this may be many times without pardon, and pardon may be many times without this. Therefore this is not a true definition of Pardon in general, neither doth this expreſs the nature of Pardon in general.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, that there may be a diſſolving of the obligation to puniſhment, where there is no real nor cordial pardon; and I prove it by this caſe: Suppoſe a King and State hath a number of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects broken out in rebellion; hereupon they iſſue out Laws and Ordinances againſt them as Traitors, and ordaining death to all that ſhall joyn with them. Here is the obligation to puniſhment paſſed againſt them all. But afterwards, when they have done much miſchief, their number increaſeth, and they become terrible to the King and State them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereupon they capitulate with them, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120067:31"/>
are forced to cancel all publique laws againſt them. Thus is their obligation to puniſhment diſſolved by the law; but yet the caſe may be, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all this diſſolution of their obligation to puniſhment in law, yet the King and State doth never pardon them really, but upon the contrary they keep in their hearts a full purpoſe to puniſh them, and chiefly the greateſt of them, who were chief authors of the rebellion, as they can catch them one by one, and one after another at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Their obligation to puniſhment by the Law here is diſſolved, but yet they are not really nor cordially pardoned; therefore theſe two are not all one.</p>
               <p>Upon the other hand, real pardon may be, when there is no diſſolving of any obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a law; and that in all pardoning and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of private offences betwixt friend and friend, where there is no ſtatute-law made upon ſuch offences. If I offend you by writing thus free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto you, (little regarding your authority, as you may perhaps perſwade your ſelf, when you are in terms of oppoſition to the truth by your tenets,) and hereupon you reſolve to puniſh me by writing as tartly back again to me; and if I, being afraid of ſuch a correction did come and ſue to you for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and if you were pleaſed freely to pardon me, or to pardon me upon condition I would recant what I had written, (which will not, I ſuppoſe, be, until I ſee good reaſon for it; but if I ſhould, and thereupon) if you did purpoſe not to puniſh me, here I would acknowledg my ſelf pardoned my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of you, but I know no obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120067:32"/>
by law between you and me, which would be diſſolved in this caſe; for there was only your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to puniſh me. But, ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter, a purpoſe to puniſh, is no obligation to puniſhment, nor makes it due.</hi> Theſe are his very words, and they ſeem to carry reaſon with them, (though I muſt inſert this, that he draweth not an Eagle-eyed conſequence from them in my apprehenſion: But thus far is clear from them, if they be true, that) therefore no obligation to puniſhment in this caſe can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, becauſe there was none by law to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, but only a purpoſe in you to puniſh; which if you were pleaſed to paſs from, I would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it to be a pardon, and thank you too, if ever I ſhould reckon the thing it ſelf a puniſhment.</p>
               <p>So that in ſuch caſes as this, and the former, it is clear, that there may be a diſſolving of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to puniſhment, where there is no real and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial pardon; as alſo there may be real and cordial pardon, where there is no diſſolving of obligation to puniſhment. Therefore theſe two are really different, and may be ſeparated the one from the other; and ſo they are not one and the ſame thing, neither can the one be the definition of the other.</p>
               <p>Now what think you fitteſt to ſay in deſence of the Eagles eyes? for me thinks they are a little dim here. Perhaps you will ſay, as you do elſwhere, He is of age, let him anſwer for himſelf: And truly I am contented to hear you both; and I profeſs I know not what either of you can ſay, until I hear you; only it may be that you will ſay for him, as I ſuſpected you would ſay for your ſelf, that theſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120067:32"/>
caſes are only between man and man, and that it is far otherwiſe when we ſpeak of the pardon, remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and forgiveneſs of God. But I ſuſpect that as this ſhift was but a ſtaff of reeds in your own hand, ſo neither will it hold water for him.</p>
               <p>For firſt, I ſay, that the Doctors definition doth agree univerſally to Pardon, both as it is in God, and as it is in man; or as it is an act of God, and as it is an act of man: In both, it is a purpoſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the will not to puniſh; and therefore it is a more proper definition them either his or yours, which is not univerſal of all Pardon in general.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, I doubt if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will own you in this difference; for he ſeveral times brings arguments and reaſons (as he thinks) together with ſimilitudes and compariſons from pardon amongſt men, in confirmation and illuſtration of his ſenſe of the pardon of God.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, I ſhall but take the caſe firſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned againſt his Definition, and alter it a little, and I am confident to clear it to be ſo fully applicable to Gods pardon and forgiveneſs alſo, againſt his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that both of you ſhall be put to your wits end to ſeek what to anſwer to it, or what to ſay in defence and behalf of thoſe definitions, the brats of your own brains. And thus I put you both to it. The Definition of Pardon which both of you do approve, (for you ſay you will not contradict Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Definition, which) is this: <hi>Pardon is the diſſolving of the obligation to puniſhment by the law, or in a law-ſenſe.</hi> Now do you think that this is a perfect definition, and that as it is diſtinct from,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120067:33"/>
and taken in oppoſition to the Doctors definition of pardon? Yes, you maintain it, or endeavour to do ſo at leaſt, <hi>totis &amp; junctis viribus,</hi> tooth and nail, as the word is. But anſwer me then this one Argument, (as it comprehends all what followeth, and taketh in alſo all that is ſpoke before againſt the Definition;) and I profeſs I ſhall publiquely maintain it with you.</p>
               <p>That Definition which neither doth agree univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to Pardon as it is in man, nor to Pardon as it is in God, is a moſt imperfect Definition:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Baxterian <hi>Definition (taken as diſtinct from, and as it oppoſeth</hi> Twiſſe's <hi>Definition of Pardon) is ſuch:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it is a ſhame to talk of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I prove the <hi>Minor,</hi> (for I ſuppoſe it only needs proof, becauſe of thoſe Maxims of perfect Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Cuicunque convenit definitio, ei convenit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum, &amp; contra; &amp; cui non convenit definitio, nec ei convenit definitum, &amp; contra; &amp; definitio &amp; definitum reciprocantur, &amp;c.</hi> I ſay, thoſe Topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Maxims make the <hi>Major</hi> unqueſtionable; and for the <hi>Minor,</hi> I prove it) thus by parts. Firſt, it doth not agree univerſally to Pardon amongſt men. To prove which, I firſt take the caſes before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced, and do ſuppoſe them as brought in again in this place, againſt the Definition, in the very words by which they are before expreſſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; and then further, I add this caſe unto them. Suppoſe once again, that a King and a State had a number of Rebels and Traitors; the Law hath put an obligation univerſally upon them all, and upon all that ſhall ever be found in arms with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:120067:33"/>
them, to the puniſhment of death; yet perhaps amongſt them there may be ſome of the chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites both of King and State: Theſe the King or State reſolveth, whatever come of the reſt, to ſpare, and not to puniſh, though they ſhould continue in rebellion to the end; or at the end, ſome others get favor by ſome means or other, ſo that the King or the State doth purpoſe not to puniſh them; or ſuppoſe that ſome of them did caſt lots for their life, and the King did purpoſe not to puniſh them whom the lots favored: I ſay, thoſe who were thus ſaved by any of thoſe ways, they were really par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and yet their obligation to puniſhment was not diſſolved by the law, nay by the law they were ſtill liable unto, and lying under the obligation to puniſhment; (for it is ſuppoſed that the law was not, nor could not be repealed, for many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences:) They were obliged to puniſhment, and that obligation was not diſſolved by the law; and yet they were pardoned. Therefore pardon, and diſſolving the obligation to puniſhment by the law, is not all one thing, for they can be really ſeparate and ſevered, and therefore they are really different the one from the other. The law condemns them, and obligeth them to puniſhment; only they are pardoned, becauſe it is the Kings purpoſe or will and pleaſure not to puniſh them; and that is their pardon, (according to the Doctors definition) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no promulgation or publiſhing of it by the law, but that it is only kept in the Kings own ſecret councel, and the Rebels are not put to puniſhment, but the execution thereof is ſuſpended by that will and pleaſure of the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:120067:34"/>So that the Doctors Definition is in every caſe the moſt proper: For whether we ſay here in this caſe, that the Law ſtands in force condemning, but the Kings will purpoſing not to puniſh ſaves and pardons; (or although Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denieth that a purpoſe not to puniſh doth diſſolve the Laws ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, yet) if it ſhould be ſaid, that the Kings will diſſolves the obligation of the Law; then ſay I, it is the Kings will not to puniſh, that is, moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, properly, and primarily pardon; becauſe the diſſolving of the Laws obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is but a conſequent following upon the Kings will not to puniſh: And whether there be any thought of the Law or not, yea whether there never had been an expreſs Law made at all, (as the caſe may be ſuppoſed, that the offence done to the King or State was ſuch, that there was no Law made at all againſt ſuch an offence, although the delinquents did hainouſly offend the King or State thereby; and if no law was made againſt it, then the obligation of no law could be diſſolved for the pardon of the offence:) yet the Kings will not to puniſh, is properly &amp; perfectly pardon. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Baxterian</hi> definition of Pardon is either quite falſe, imperfect, and impertinent here in this caſe; or elſe, if it have any truth at all in it, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the thing it ſelf, it is but in ſo far as it is all one with the <hi>Twiſſian</hi> definition of Pardon; and therefore it is falſely and impertinently aſſerted for a perfect Definition, and true, as it is diſtinct from, and taken in oppoſition to the Doctors definition of Pardon, ſince it is only true as it is all one with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:120067:34"/>But 2. for the ſecond part of the <hi>Minor,</hi> and which is moſt againſt you both, the caſe will be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſubject to leſs exception; to wit, when it is ſpoken of Gods pardon and forgiveneſs: For I ſay that your definition of pardon doth either not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at all to that pardon that is in God; or if it do agree to truth and to that pardon which is in God, it is only in ſo far as it is quite coincident and all one with the Doctors definition of Pardon; and therefore falſly aſſerted as true, as it is diſtinct from and taken in oppoſition to it. For you ſay, that Pardon is the diſſolving of the Laws obligation to puniſhment: But I ſay, that this definition of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don doth not agree at all to that which is the moſt proper pardon in God, to wit, his pardoning of the Elect from eternity, as to the puniſhment of eternal death. For firſt, God hath from eternity decreed not to puniſh the ſins of the elect in Chriſt with eternal death: This, I ſay, is the real and cordial pardon in the breaſt of God of all the elect, as to that puniſhment; and yet they themſelves are not diſſolved by the law of Grace from the obligation to that puniſhment, till they believe. So that here the Elect are really pardoned in the breaſt of God before they believe, (though they know not of it themſelves) as to eternal death; and yet their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation by the law to that death, is not diſſolved by the law of grace, till they believe. Therefore theſe two are not one and the ſame, nay they are really different, becauſe they may be really ſevered and ſeparated the one from the other, even when we ſpeak of Gods pardoning and forgiveneſs of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:120067:35"/>I do not think, Sir, that you can juſtly call this Argument <hi>petitio principii,</hi> a begging of that which is in the queſtion: For I do ſuppoſe I have already done no leſs then wreſted it out of your hands by ſtrength and force of reaſon, though I do verily believe that any rational unprejudiced underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would have granted the truth in the point wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, it is ſo clear of it ſelf: And whether it be not ſo, I do again but propoſe it, and leave it to be judged by any rational conſideration; to wit, That ſeeing amongſt all rational men, a willing purpoſe, or a free reſolution of the will not to puniſh offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and offences, is really and perfectly pardon of theſe offences and offenders, and is properly to be ſo called. So that whoſoever hath ſuch a will, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to puniſh, but to accept into favor, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to pardon and forgive thoſe offenders and offences, which he doth ſo willingly purpoſe not to puniſh.</p>
               <p>Since it is ſo, I ſay, amongſt all men univerſally, as when a King purpoſeth and reſolveth not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, he pardons; and when any other private man purpoſeth not to puniſh other mens offences to him, when it is in his power to do it, he pardons them, whether it be towards equals, ſuperiors, or inferiors: Then alſo when God purpoſeth freely not to puniſh the ſins of his elect in Chriſt with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death, doth he not really, perfectly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly pardon them, as to that puniſhment? and is he not properly ſaid to do ſo? Nay, doth he not then far more perfectly pardon, when he purpoſeth not to puniſh, then any man doth? Becauſe a man may reſolve now not to puniſh, and afterwards
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120067:35"/>
change in his reſolution: but our God is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who changeth not in his reſolutions, but is immutable in all the purpoſes of his will. And if ſo, then doth he perfectly pardon all the ſins of all his elect in Chriſt, even from eternity; becauſe, firſt, he hath purpoſed not to puniſh them with eternal death; and ſecondly, all his purpoſes are immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal. You your ſelf not daring to deny either of theſe; or if you dare deny either of them, let it be but made known by your next, and I dare undertake (God willing) you ſhal be made aſhamed of it.</p>
               <p>But (Sir) again, although this laſt Argument againſt your Definition of Pardon, hath mainly related to Gods eternal pardon, or purpoſe not to puniſh; yet it may be made alſo good to oppugn your Definition of Pardon, becauſe neither doth it agree to that pardon of God, which is, as you muſt acknowledg from your own principles, even in time; for when God doth work faith in the heart of a ſinner, and doth make him a ſincere Convert and a ſound Believer in Chriſt, doth not God purpoſe, or is there not then a full reſolution in the will of God not to puniſh that believing ſinner with eternal death? Yes, Sir, you dare not deny it, unleſs you apoſtatize from the fundamentals of Chriſtianity, this being one of the chief thereof, That whoſoever believeth in him, and ſo cometh to him by true faith, him he will in no ways caſt out, and that he ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life: And that this is done according to the purpoſe of the will of God; for this is the will of the Father, that of all thoſe who are given unto the Son, and who come
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:120067:36"/>
unto him by ſaving faith, not any one ſhould periſh. This is certain then, that God hath purpoſed not to puniſh with eternal death the ſins of any true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: I ſay, that this purpoſe and intention is in God, (at leaſt when any one doth actually believe, even according to your own principles) to wit, not to puniſh the ſins of any true believer with eternal death, is paſt queſtion: But Sir, ſay I, then your Definition is undone, as to the perfection of it in oppoſition to <hi>Twiſſe's</hi> Definition of Pardon. For this you will grant me, which I will lay down for a ground; That what once God hath purpoſed, he hath immutably purpoſed it, and cannot change it. If you deny it, let the world once know the atheiſm of ſuch a principle, and I hope it ſhall be ſoon hiſſed out. But a Believer whom God hath thus once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably purpoſed not to puniſh with eternal death, (and ſo whom he hath immutably pardoned as to that puniſhment, and therefore who never can be unpardoned again in the breaſt of God, becauſe that purpoſe not to puniſh with eternal death, can never be recalled again; yet I ſay, even ſuch a one) may fall grievouſly (though not totally nor finally, becauſe God will perfect the good work of grace begun in him, in the time and by the means he thinks meeteſt,) from his firſt love, not only by hainous ſinning againſt God actually, but by continuing in an habitually ſinful condition for ſo long a time, too too much ſad experience doth dolefully teſtifie this to be too true, alas for it! yet the foundation of the Lord ſtandeth ſure, and he knoweth who are his own choſen ones, whom he hath immutably purpoſed not to puniſh with eternal death; ſo that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120067:36"/>
he will never change that purpoſe, and therefore they are fully and perfectly pardoned in his breaſt for ever as to that puniſhment. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the time of that their foreſaid ſinful eſtate and condition, the Law threatens them, and obligeth them to puniſhment for their ſins, even to no leſs then eternal puniſhment; for ſuch it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to all univerſally living in ſuch ſins, as even a Believer may fall and continue in for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Here the perſon is pardoned in the breaſt of God as to eternal puniſhment; for he hath immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably purpoſed never to inflict that upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Believer, though in a backſliding condition; and yet the obligation of the Law unto that ſame puniſhment, is not diſſolved actually as to him living in ſuch an impenitent and ſinful condition; (at leaſt this muſt be moſt certain, according to the <hi>Baxterian</hi> principles, which do acknowledg no ſin to be pardoned, and ſo the obligation of the Law to puniſhment for it not to be diſſolved before it be committed, and till the ſinner actuate faith and repentance about it.) Nay, it threatens him with it, and binds him over to it, as juſtly deſerving it, becauſe of his living and walking in ſuch ſins: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pardon is not the diſſolving of the Laws obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment; becauſe here there is Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or a purpoſe not to puniſh with eternal death in the breaſt of God, which perfectly pardoneth, abſolveth, and freeth him from the real danger of that death, which is a real and a perfect pardon from the puniſhment thereof; and yet the Law is not diſſolved from its obligation of him to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but is of force againſt him, binding him
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120067:37"/>
over to it, as his due deſert in himſelf, becauſe of his ſins, and ſo ſinful a condition. Therefore theſe two are not all one, to wit, Pardon from eternal puniſhment, and the diſſolving of the Laws obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto that puniſhment. For here in this caſe they are ſevered and really ſeparated one from the other; therefore they are really diſtinct one from the other; and hence the one cannot be the nature, and expreſs the definition of the other.</p>
               <p>I do profeſs I do here again, and more then ever, ſtand a little and amuſe my ſelf what can be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you, eſpecially upon the <hi>Baxterian</hi> (Semi-Arminian) principles, which go ſo nigh to affirm that ſuch a man in ſuch a caſe ſhould be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as quite and totally fallen away from grace; and that the law of grace doth diſſolve the obligation to puniſhment for no actual known ſin, far leſs to a habitual living in ſin for a time, till actual faith and repentancc be newly performed. But here the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſuppoſed to lie not only in a ſinful, but in an impenitent condition; ſo that the law of grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſſolve him in ſuch a condition from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the law of death, to the puniſhment thereof. And yet he that ſhould ſay, that in the ſuppoſed caſe, (wherein the perſon is ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally in the breaſt of God to be freed and abſolved from that puniſhment of eternal death, and ſo to be perfectly pardoned as to that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe God is ſuppoſed immutably to have purpoſed not to inflict it upon him, becauſe one ſuppoſed alſo to be elected in Chriſt, and once a real and true believer: I ſay, that whoſoever dare fay that) ſuch a one, though in ſuch a condition, is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:120067:37"/>
not really and perfectly pardoned, as to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of eternal death; he dareth to belie the Truth of God to the face, which ſheweth us, That God is immutable in all the purpoſes of his will, (and ſo one once freed from eternal death by a purpoſe thereof, can never be in real danger of it again, although he know not ſo much and therefore ought to fear it in himſelf;) and that though he chaſtiſe his children and people, once in Covenant with him, by Faith in Chriſt, and correct them for their ſins, when they turn away from him; (So that a believing ſinner, in ſuch a back-ſliding condition, may indeed be, and is in danger of falling under many ſad ſtrokes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential, fatherly, and caſtigatory corrections of ſeveral ſorts: For I never do ſay, that God hath purpoſed not to inflict upon him any of thoſe temporary chaſtiſements, by which he uſeth as means to bring home to himſelf, his ſheep that has gone aſtray from him, and bewildred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by wandring in the vanity and wickedneſs of their own inventions for a ſeaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall not much make a quarrel with the <hi>Baxterian</hi> princip es, for ſaying, That Believers are not perfectly freed in this life, from thoſe temporal and correcting ſtrokes of fatherly and loving chaſtiments; becauſe, as is ſaid, God hath not purpoſed not to inflict ſuch temporary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections upon them for their ſins, in their eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from him in this life; yet I ſay notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all thoſe, his truth, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he correct them with thoſe rods of tender and fatherly-hearted men,) yet his mercy and his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:120067:38"/>
loving kindneſs, he will never remove from them; nor break his Covenant with them, by quite again turning them out of it, whom he hath once taken within it, in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, if you will grant thoſe Truths, and ſay, That that purpoſe of Gods will not to puniſh ſuch an Elect Believer with eternal death, doth diſſolve the Laws Obligation, as to that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he being the ſupreme Law-maker himſelf: Then, I ſay, firſt, That if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſay ſo, he will contradict himſelf in the defence of his own definition; for he ſaith and affirmeth expreſly, That a purpoſe to puniſh, is no obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that a purpoſe not to puniſh, is no remiſſion of any ſuch duneſs to obligation, and ſo no diſſolving of any obl gation: And if you, Sir, ſay ſo for him, as, if there be any truth in that which he and you ſay both, in the point of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence about the definition; you muſt ſay ſo, and can ſay nothing elſe, for ought that I know, to the ſuppoſed caſe; then I ſay, That the <hi>Baxterian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, ſo much contended for, falls to the ground, becauſe all the truth that is in it, is co-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with the Doctors definition of pardon, to wit, That it is a purpoſe or determination of the will not to puniſh, which is perfect pardon in it ſelf, Whether the Law be diſſolved, or whether there be any Law to be diſſolved, or not at all: And therefore it is moſt irrationally maintained and diſputed for ſo much, as true, being taken as diſtinct from, and in oppoſition to the Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of pardon; from which, his hath all the truths in it, if it hath any in it all, in the caſes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:120067:38"/>
propounded. I have one caſe yet more, Sir, briefly to propound againſt your ſo much fought for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of pardon, and then to concluded, by trampling it under <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his definition, ſo that it ſhall never again riſe to oppoſe it. The caſe is this, Sir, Suppoſe, when <hi>Adam</hi> had faln, that God had not proclaimed unto him the Law of Grace in Chriſt, the Seed of the Woman, immediately after his fall; I think you will acknowledge the caſe ſuppoſed, and the ſuppoſition poſſible, for it was in the free choice of God, how, and at what time to reveal the way of Salvation to loſt man man by the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Well, you will ſay, let the caſe be ſuppoſed, What will ye make it; onely, Sir, I would deſire you but to anſwer me this one queſtion. <hi>In that ſuppoſition, and before there was any Saviour revealed to</hi> Adam, <hi>could not God have pardoned</hi> Adam? <hi>Or could not he, freely have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given his ſin of diſobedience to his commands? And that, without making known unto him a way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs by Faith in the Son, and Saviour of the World.</hi> It may be now, Sir, you may gueſs, and give a hint at that which I aim at; and I can alſo, by remembring what I read in your Book, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture how you would anſwer the queſtion, if you be ſtedfaſt to your Tenets. But the truth in my thoughts is, Sir, that I do eſteem that opinion from which I do conceive (by what I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I did hear you ſpeak, a little to, once or twice in your diſcourſe, when I ſell firſt in conference with you) That you would draw your anſwer to the queſtion here propoſed, I ſay I do account that opinion (from which vou would anſwer the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:120067:39"/>
queſtion propoſed) to be no leſs then Blaſphemy; for ſo it ſounds in my ears, every ſyllable of it, and ſo my thoughts cannot ruminate upon it otherways; and therefore in words I can afford no better expreſſion about it, who ever be the authors and abettors of it; and if you pleaſe by your next, to call for an account of ſo harſh a cenſure, I hope you ſhall as readily have the grounds of the cenſure, as here you have the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it ſelf: In the mean time, Sir, I do propoſe the queſtion above named, to any retional under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and I am confident, the very rational light of natural Reaſon will dictate unto me this anſwer, That God might, and could (if he would) have pardoned <hi>Adam</hi> freely without infinite ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; nay, I ſay, that there is no impoſſibility, nor repugnant implication of contradiction in this ſuppoſition: But that when God called to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, as he fled (fooliſhly) for fear, and ſhame, to hide himſelf; and after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of his ſin, and drawn him to an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgment of it, as <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> and of his guilt, and deſert of death, that immediatly, upon that acknowledgment, it was poſſible; and no implication of contradiction in it, That God might not onely have pardoned him, as <hi>Nathan</hi> declared <hi>David</hi> to be pardoned: But he might alſo have immediately (if he had pleaſed) tranſlated him to glory, by taking him up preſently to himſelf, ſo that he ſhould have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no longer upon earth, as he did to <hi>Enoch;</hi> I ſay, the light of nature demonſtrateth, that God might, and could have done ſo, if he had pleaſed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:120067:39"/>
without any wrong, or contradiction to his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Juſtice for the rational light of nature dictateth this principle, That the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the abſolutely ſupreme Law-giver, Maker, and Governor of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the abſolute rule of all Righteouſneſs and Juſtice: If you think otherways, Sir, tell us by your next, and perhaps you ſhall be told again, That you think irration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Well then, I will ſuppoſe, until I hear from you, that God might have ſo pardoned <hi>Adam</hi> before he had revealed unto him, that his <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> Chriſt, the Seed of the Woman, was appointed to deſtroy the works of the Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed caſe of pardon, Sir, What ſay you to the <hi>Baxterian</hi> definition of pardon? Where would then have been the diſſolving of the obligation to puniſhment by the Law of Grace? When in the caſe ſuppoſed, the Law of Grace would not have been at all proclaimed, to diſſolve any obligation to puniſhment by the Law of Death: What would have been more in ſuch a pardon, in that or the like caſe, then the meer free and gracious will of God, freely paſſing from his right of the ſtrictneſs of rigorous puniſhment: and ſo reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to puniſh <hi>Adam</hi> by death, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of his command? I think it is here clear as the Sun (not over clouded) at Noon in a bright day, That there would have been nothing here in ſuch a pardon, but the will, and the purpoſe of it, not to puniſh, and ſo freeing from deſerved puniſhment; and yet this would have been as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a pardon, I think, as <hi>Adam</hi> would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and it would have been as proper a pardon
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:120067:40"/>
as any that could be ſo called. The truth is, Sir, I wonder not a little, that Eagles eyes did not ſee thorough ſo far, as to reach the conſideration of thoſe, or ſome ſuch caſes, when they did look about them every where to catch hold on all the ſtones they poſſibly could, to caſt at Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi>'s definition of pardon, which they look ſo much a ſquint upon.</p>
               <p>But perhaps, Sir, you will yet enquire what the caſe above mentioned will make againſt the <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> definition of pardon? and I will yet again tell you, it will throw a ſtone at it which will do more to it, then all that both of you can throw at Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi>'s; and that is, it will lay it flat on its back, and meaſure it with the earth becauſe it is but a moſt imperfect one, and no definition at all of pardon, ſince in any poſſible ſuppoſition it can be really ſevered and ſeparated from it; for I hope, you will acknowledge the nature and eſſence of a thing in its true definition, cannot in any poſſible or imaginable conſideration be really ſeparated from it, as is ſaid before; for elſe a thing could be really ſeparated from it ſelf, which is a contradiction: <hi>Homo,</hi> I think, <hi>&amp; animal rationale,</hi> cannot poſſibly, be ſeparated and really ſevered the one from the other: And, Sir, if ye can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly mention me but one caſe of pardon, that hath not the Doctors definition of pardon included in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, I ſhall quite you the cauſe, and never more diſpute againſt you, nor your definition either, nor againſt any other <hi>Baxterian</hi> principle; for I am ſure, that pardon, remiſſion, or forgiveneſs of offences, is a rational and voluntary act, ſhewing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:120067:40"/>
mercy upon ſome deſerving or ſuppoſed to deſerve puniſhment in whomſoever it exiſteth; and that cannot be done without the conſent or purpoſe of the will, not to puniſh.</p>
               <p>I have almoſt done now, Sir, with this diſpute (its time ere now, perhaps you may think, and truly ſo do I my ſelf, if I could have left it ſooner, after I did put hand to the Pen about it: But now, I ſay, I have near done with it) were it not to tell you, (now when I think on it) and to accuſe my ſelf for it, that I might have ſaved my ſelf a great deal of this labor, if I had minded it well: You, and others perhaps, may think ſo to; but I believe the ground of our thoughts are not the ſame, whatever yours be, Sir. I will tell you my ground, why I think I might have ſpared moſt of my pains; in thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting againſt your definitions: I had thought always hitherto, Sir, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and you had been utter enemies to Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi>'s definition of pardon. I am ſure, I think any other would have thought ſo to, for I am confident, that by you both, there have been above a hundred wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons ſpent againſt it; that is, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and you have uſed a hundred and odd Arguments, and (at leaſt, ſeeming) Reaſons againſt Dr. <hi>Twiſſes</hi> definition of pardon, and the conſequents of it: For in one place of one of his Books, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> formeth (or faineth) no leſs then fourty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I am ſure, in the reſt of that Book, and his other Books, he hath above other fourty formed againſt it, in it ſelf, and its conſequences: And I am perſwaded in your little Book, there are above twenty (ſeeming) Reaſons and (feigned) Arguments againſt it, in it ſelf, and in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:120067:41"/>
Now, I ſay, that all this quarter that you keep, and all this ſtir that you make againſt that poor definition of the Doctors, would have made another as well as I, think, that you had been indeed enemies to it; and when all comes to all, and now I conſider better upon it, I think there are none greater friends to it, then ye, and none does more maintain it, then ye; ſo that if Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> had been deſirous of two ſure and ſolid Pillars to under-prop his definition, when himſelf was dead and gone, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hotchkis,</hi> might have been the two men for his purpoſe; and that in thoſe very definitions which they would ſeem to the world to bring, and which all the world would really think they did indeed bring in oppoſition to his. I verily believe, Sir, that you do think I jeſt with you now, but really you are miſtaken with me, in thinking I ſpeak in jeſt, when I ſpeak in good earneſt unto you, as well as I was miſtaken with you, in thinking you did, in earneſt diſpute againſt Doctor <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his definition of pardon; when, it ſeems to me now, you were but in jeſt againſt it, and onely <hi>diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi gratia,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>acumen</hi> and ſharpneſs of your wits, even in diſputing <hi>pro utraque parte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictionis;</hi> when you are really for it, and do bring one ſtrong Argument (I dare ſay as ſtrong and ſtronger then any, yea, then all of the hundred that you have brought ſeemingly againſt it) to maintain and defend it. In plain terms, Sir, I ſee, its dangerous diſputing with Eagle-eyed ones, for they will ſee much that others cannot ſee; yea, they may perſwade others that the Moon is made
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:120067:41"/>
of Green-cheeſe, and that they are diſputing againſt a definition, when they are really diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for it; and that by ſuch an argument as in my judgment is no leſs then unanſwerable, even by themſelvs, if it were form'd againſt them both, thus. The diſſolving of the Laws obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> definition, and the effectual taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf, according to Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> his definition of pardon; is properly pardon, or the nature of forgiveneſs of ſin; but, the will of God not to puniſh (which is Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his definition of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) is the diſſolving of the Laws obligation to puniſhment, and the effectual taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf: therefore the will of God not to puniſh, which is Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi>'s definition of pardon (ſo much ſeemingly, at leaſt, oppugned by Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hotchkis,</hi> yet) is true and really, or properly pardon, and the nature of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin. and that even according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> themſelves, and their own principles and definitions, notwithſtanding all their ſeeming diſputes againſt it.</p>
               <p>I do not ſpeak truth, Sir, if I think not really, That although there had never another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been brought to defend Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi>'s defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pardon, to be true, and to expreſs fully the nature of remiſſion of ſins, but this one: It had unanſwerably done, and doth now (againſt your ſelves) irrefragably and unqueſtionably the buſineſs to the full, againſt all that would not irrationally oppoſe it: For, I know not a thought that can enter in any of your heads
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:120067:42"/>
againſt the Argument, but to make a demur a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and with ſcrupling thoughts to be touched to the quick by the <hi>Minor:</hi> And when you have vexed your ſelves in an irkſom conſideration about it, I am confident, That the light of your own Reaſon ſhall neceſſitate and force from you, a plain (though, becauſe in contradiction to your ſelves, a forced and unwilling) ſubſcription to the truth of it; at leaſt, I am ſure, and fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that every unprejudiced rational conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (beſides your ſelves, and that is all I care for, if you ſhould deny it) will willingly ſubſcribe to the truth of the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition; for there is nothing in it but this, That the will of the moſt ſupreme, and moſt abſolute Law-giver, to paſs from the ſtrict rigor of the puniſhment (that he might have juſtly inflicted by vertue) of a former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed Law, and not to puniſh according to that Law, as that will doth <hi>eo ipſo</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> immediately and fully pardon the Delinquents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Law, ſo it doth <hi>eo ipſo</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> immediately deſtroy and diſſolve the obligation to puniſhment by that Law, and doth effectually take away (ſince his will is omnipotent and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible; and therefore always effectual, as well as immutable) the puniſhment due to delinquents, according to that formerly publiſhed Law: And whether that ſuch a will not to puniſh be ſignified, either by another Law, or by a ſimple Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, or by the effects of it, that is nothing material; for ſtill the will it ſelf of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſupreme Law-maker, and in it ſelf (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be publiſhed) doth diſſolve the obligation
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:120067:42"/>
to puniſhment, and effectually take away the puniſhment it ſelf, as to the thing it ſelf, and really, although it may be not for ſome ſeaſon to the knowledge of the pardoned by ſuch a will, yet I ſay really, <hi>reipſa,</hi> and in effect ſuch a will (of an abſolutely ſupreme, omnipotent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Law-maker) not to puniſh by the Law, doth take away effectually, both the obligation to puniſhment by that Law, and the puniſhment it ſelf, according to that Law; from thoſe that are the objects of ſuch a will not to puniſh, and ſo who are really and effectually (although they did not know ſo much themſelves, yet in the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers Breſt) pardoned by it; and ſo are for ever out of real danger of falling into that puniſhment threatned by the other Law, (becauſe an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and omnipotent Law-giver hath purpoſed not to inflict it upon them,) although they may in their own apprehenſion, and ſo far as they know, or for ought that they have for aſſurance to the contrary, be under an apprehenſive danger (as I may call it, for it is not real, but really and immutably taken away) of that puniſhment due to them, according to the former Law, until the time that the Law-giver himſelf think fit to make known his will not to puniſh by that Law unto them, either by publiſhing another Law, or by a ſimple Declaration of his will, or by the real ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, or ſome way or other, as he thinks fitteſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>If theſe be not the dictates of Natural light, I know not what are ſuch, (and theſe are nothing but the <hi>Minor</hi> of the former Argument explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;)
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:120067:43"/>
and I leave it to the rational conſideration of others, without prejudice, to judge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine about them: Onely this much I adde, Sir, to you, and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that I think you will not deny, That the Covenant or Law of Grace, is nothing but the will of God, not to puniſh by or according to the former Law of Death, ſo (and in ſuch terms as it runs upon, to wit, of appointing Salvation by Faith in Chriſt) publiſhed, diſſolving the obligation, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taking away the puniſhment of the Law of Death, which is all I require; for it is the <hi>Minor</hi> of the former Argument, which I leave you to ruminate upon, and to queſtion quietly between your ſelves too. Whether it be your Argument or mine; until next time, you be pleaſed to let me hear from you both, how you have determine'd the queſtion between you, and I ſhall, I hope, God willing, give my thoughts upon what ſhall be the reſult of your determination.</p>

                  <p>I Have done now, Sir, (at this time at leaſt) with the defence of great Dr. <hi>Twiſſe's</hi> Definition of Pardon and Remiſſion of ſin: And if you would know how I do after ſuch a diſpute; Truly, Sir, I'll tell you freely, I was once or twice weary at the length of my writing, ſince it was to be incloſed within the precinct of Epiſtolary lines; but I am not yet weary of (nor will be, I hope, when I am more put to) the defence of the controverſie it ſelf, and the diſputes about it, or the controverſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and conſequents depending upon it, and having connexion with it: As likewiſe, Sir, I'll tell you now, what I told you not before, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now when I look over my papers, reckoning them and the time taken up in writing of them, I do perceive I have ſpent moſt of the hours in three days, in putting my extemporary conceptions upon four full ſheets of paper anent this queſtion; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, I ſay, I have ſpent ſo much time and pains about it, yet not only when I did firſt hear your diſcourſe in your Diſſertation, which was preciſely this day fortnight agone, I had no ſuch intention, but till <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning laſt paſt about ſix a clock, and now it is <hi>Friday</hi> in the morning a little after the ſame hour, I had not ſo much as a thought to touch the Doctors Definition, or the defence of it againſt you; but I had paſſed it over lightly in your book, as I had ſeveral times done before in Mr. <hi>Baxter's,</hi> (though not without a little indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I muſt confeſs, at the boldneſs of you both for it, in contradicting ſo regardleſly the Doctor in ſo clear a truth) without taking any reſolution
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120067:44"/>
at all to make a queſtion about it, and the points depending upon it, with either of you; but only to touch a little the point that is firſt put down in this Epiſtle, in the lines directed to your Patron himſelf, and immediately to go on to the work that is now to follow in ſome lines moe, to be directed to you indeed, but having reference to him alſo, both of you being to be equally concerned into them: (as I think in all or moſt other differences you muſt either ſtand or fall together.)</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, (as is ſaid) upon Tueſday morning, as I was about preſently to fall upon the task now to be in hand, it did come into my mind, that if it were but in a parentheſis, or in ſome few lines, I might only tell you, that you and your Patron wronged the Doctor that is dead very much, and that in diſputing againſt him (in my apprehenſion) meerly ſophiſtically, (and hence was the occaſion of the fallacie I mentioned, and conceived your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſophiſticating in, all alongſt when you touch the point in queſtion, or the queſtions depending upon it;) becauſe that in all your diſproving of his Definition of Pardon, you do not (or would not, at leaſt, let the world know that you did) take notice, that the only intent of the Doctor by that Definition was to deſcribe unto us, (not thoſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods pardon, and remiſſion of ſins, as it conſiſteth in diſſolving the laws obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, by the law of grace, and in the effectual taking away of the puniſhment it ſelf, thoſe notions, ſo far as there is any truth in them, you cannot produce a word out of him, I am confident of it, that ever he did deny: But, I ſay, his intention by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120067:44"/>
that Definition of his, was not to define or explain thoſe Nations in your heads; but to give us his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and you alſo his antagoniſts a deſcription, and that as all deſcriptions of his were, an accurate one of) that pardon of God which is really in God, to wit, that mental and eternal pardon in his breaſt, by which, from and unto all eternity he doth free and abſolve his elect ones in Chriſt, from the real danger of eternal puniſhment for their ſins in time; this pardon being nothing elſe, (as the Doctor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately deſcribes it to our underſtandings;) but that immutable purpoſe of his will from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and (continuing ſtedfaſt) unto all eternity, not to puniſh them with that eternal death, which they otherwiſe, were it not for that pardon, deſervedly muſt, and would have ſuffered, for their ſins in time.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, was only the the Doctors mind by that Definition; and yet you will aver, (I tell you of it again, that you may be aſhamed of ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, like unto the barking &amp; jarring—at a dead Lion) that ſo great a man was ignorant of that which every Chriſtian not only doth, but muſt know, to wit, That by the law of Grace, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment by the law of Works threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is diſſolved; and that puniſhment is effectually taken away from believing and pardoned ſinners, in the pardon and remiſſion of their ſins: And that that great Doctor, whoſe doctrine (drawn from the Word of truth in the Scriptures, and from thoſe ſparkles of pure rational light that in ſome meaſure is left in every reaſonable breaſt) about the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ever to be adored immutable Decrees of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120067:45"/>
God, and the diſtinction of them from the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in time, hath amazed the world where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath come to be ſeen in his Works, for the profoundneſs and depth of knowledg thereof; that yet, Sir, notwithſtanding all his ſuperexcellent labors and works this way, you ſhould dare more nor once or twice in your little Libel, as your Patron dareth often in his Works, to reproach the Doctor as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant to diſtinguiſh between the Decree of God, and the Execution thereof: I profeſs I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but laugh at it, firſt, for a while; and then afterwards, Sir, tell you, that in my thoughts he knew more of thoſe Myſteries, then a hundred of you both, though all of that hundred had a hundred ſuch Eagle-eyes in their heads, as the other of you two is feigned and imagined by you to have. I do but ſay feigned and imagined here, but I ſhall prove it by and by in ſome things below, and that the more eagerly in great Doctor <hi>Twiſſe's</hi> behalf.</p>
                  <p>Thus much, Sir, or ſome ſuch like buſineſs, I was only reſolved thus to have hinted at in the begining of the laſt Diſpute, and ſo to have gone forward: But when once I did begin to write, I could not put a ſtop to the current of my thoughts, till they had run all the length they did, before I could give over; and they had run further yet, for there was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately moe to come forth, if I had not violently ſtopped them; at that laſt, in my apprehenſion, ſo pertinent an Argument to the purpoſe, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that I cannot tell yet well whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould call it yours or mine, without this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; That it is yours (Sir) for the matter and medium of it, and mine only for reducing it to a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120067:45"/>
form to your hand; though I did think then, and I do think yet, an Eagles eye might have ſeen that it might have been ſo reduced as an objection to himſelf, if he had ſo minded the matter.</p>
                  <p>Thus Sir, I muſt be ſuffered to breathe a little, before I begin a new ſubject. Yet having ſome end in ſuch a breathing alſo, to wit, That if ever you let me or the world hear your thoughts upon what is written unto you before, you would be pleaſed rationally to take notice of what is material in it, and not to ſtand too much upon all (conceived per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by you) extravagancies, and punctilio's of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities; as knowing that it may be replied unto you, That it was told you before, that you had no elaborate or premeditate Diſcourſe preſented to your view, but only the excurſions of undigeſted thoughts, rudely and courſely as they did preſently reſult in the mind, put upon paper, in haſte, to kiſs your hands, Sir.</p>
                  <p>But for all the haſte, I have not done with you yet; for I have ſomwhat more of my mind to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto you, about ſome other particulars of no little concernment, in which I do conceive both your Patron and you are not a little miſtaken, or elſe I am very much miſtaken. And to ſhew that one of us is much miſtaken indeed, I for my part am ſo confident that the miſtake in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth lieth upon your ſide, as that I muſt premiſe thus much; That although I do imagine that ſome may think that I do take a dangerous task in hand, thus ever and anon, in one point after another, to be carping and medling with no others then men of Eagles eyes; yet in the buſineſs that followeth to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:120067:46"/>
be called in queſtion, I am ſo far from dreading any danger from ſuch ſharpneſs of ſight, that I dare affirm, that both you and your Patron, Sir, are ſo far from either of you having the eyes of an Eagle in the points you are now to be called in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that if I do not prove you both to have no eyes at all to ſee with of your own, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee nothing at all in thoſe points with your own eyes, but that all the dim ſight you have (or at leaſt that you have manifeſted your ſelves to have in your writings) about thoſe things, you have it but only by ſeeing with other mens eyes, and meerly relying upon other mens words, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcerning faculty of your own, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how much, or how far they ſpeak right or wrong: If I do not, I ſay, make good what here is challenged, (for as harſhly and tartly as it may here ſeem to be worded) againſt all the four eyes of you both; I do promiſe to ſhut and turn away both mine own eys from ever looking upon a Book again, (after your next to free your ſelf, when it comes to my hand) whilſt I breathe; which I am ſo far unwilling to do, that if I know my own heart, I would diſdain no leſs then a Kingdom, if it were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto me meerly upon the condition that I ſhould never look again upon one Book only; and that is ſuch a one, which I believe (Sir) neither of you did ever look upon in your days underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, nor minded much to do, if by theſe prefents you be not ſomwhat put to it, (ſo far are we differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it ſeems, in our eſtimation and judgment about moe things then one, as not only in ſo many of our different Opinions, but in our pricing and prizing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120067:46"/>
but one Book, that you would not care much though you never did ſee it, and <hi>I</hi> would not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit the ſight of it for all my life, no not for what poſſibly could be given me from man on this ſide of heaven, or in the world here below,) And the name of this Book, Sir, ſo little by you and your Patron, and ſo much prized by me, is in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage called, The <hi>Hebrew Bible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now at length, Sir, is uſhered in that which at the beginning of this Epiſtolary diſcourſe <hi>I</hi> did chiefly, yea at this time only intend; (the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> being intended at firſt to have been but as an introduction to this in a very few lines; and this laſt diſpute with you coming in meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the by, and not being intended when <hi>I</hi> did begin to write this Miſſive, at all: But now <hi>I</hi> ſay, Sir, at laſt I am come to that which <hi>I</hi> chiefly intend by thoſe papers,) to wit, to inform you of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice I had taken in peruſing your book, of the little notice which you had taken of that Book of books above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hebrew Bible.</hi> And here, Sir, I muſt firſt, ere I go any further, put both you and my ſelf in mind of this, That there is a far greater buſineſs now in hand, then was in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between us before, and a great deal more weighty, and more deeply to be taken in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as being of far more concernment in it ſelf and its conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Before, Sir, in our laſt diſpute, the queſtion was but about the words of a man, though a great one indeed) but here the queſtion will be about the words of one that is infinitey greater and higher then the greateſt and higheſt of men, even about
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:120067:47"/>
the words of the moſt High God himſelf. Before, the Diſpute was but about the ſenſing aright, or the right underſtanding of an Orthodox Doctors Definition; but here the diſpute will be about the right or wrong interpretation of the holy Spirits definitions in Scriptures, which muſt be the canon and rule for orthodox Doctors to judg of ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Tenets, and for Chriſtians to try the ſpirits of men in their opinions of religion by. It was not a little wrong done to the dead by you, when you did calumniate and falſly accuſe a dead man, even the moſt knowing and orthodox School-Divine, (for the moſt profound and deepeſt controverſies in School-Divinity,) of ignorance and error; and that in thoſe very points about which he knew more, (becauſe more was revealed to him from above, what in his naturals and ſupernaturals to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) then I verily believe moſt of the world did know beſides himſelf; at leaſt I am ſure he hath left more behind him to teſtifie of his knowledg in thoſe points, then any of the world hath done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf: And therefore, Sir, I ſay it was a great injury done to his remembrance by you, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in fifteen or ſixteen ſheets of paper of your <hi>Lucubratiunculoe,</hi> and often by your imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Patron, to accuſe and calumniate ſuch a one of ignorance and error, in points for which all his Antagoniſts will never be able to compare with him.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, it will be found a greater injury done by you to the Living GOD, if you calumniate his words, adding unto them what is not found written in them at all, to make them countenance you and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:120067:47"/>
your Patron in your ſingular opinions. To put more into any mans words, then is indeed in them, to make them either for us or againſt us in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, is not fair dealing between man and man, nay it is a clear breach of the command that inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and forbids bearing falſe witneſs againſt our neighbor: But to put more into the words of God then indeed is to be found in them, is to bear falſe witneſs againſt God; which is as much more a ſin greater then the other, as God is above man in greatneſs, and as his words are above mans words in truth, which is no leſs then an infinite diſtance and diſproportion in both. I wiſh, Sir, the matter of thoſe words, or ſuch like, and thoſe or ſuch like grounds, were more ſeriouſly laid to heart and more ſolidly conſidered, then is the faſhion now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days to do; and then the Scriptures in themſelves and in their own words would be more diligently ſearched into and ſtudied; and I hope they ſhall be much more hereafter ſtudied, then now they are, or hitherto have been.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, to come to the buſineſs in particular which hath occaſioned this Preface, which I ſuſpect you may perhaps look upon as tartly reflecting upon your own intereſt and your Patrons; the truth is, Sir, I'll never leſſen your conjecture in this point, but by and by I'll add ſomewhat unto it rather, to the end that the more ſeriouſly you may lay to heart what hath been ſpoken. Only firſt, Sir, becauſe when that we are to give a true account and eſtimate of a man or of his works, it is very unjuſt and unequal to ſpeak any thing of him that tends to his prejudice and diſcommendation, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:120067:48"/>
not withall to take notice of what is praiſe-worthy in him, and tends to his profit and commendation: Therefore, Sir, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſpeak any thing further in the things that diſpleaſed me in your book, when I firſt read it, (and which I think ſhould alſo diſpleaſe you, when you are put to the conſideration of them; I ſay, before I ſpeak of thoſe offenſive places) I will firſt take notice of one or two paſſages for which I highly commend you; and that is, becauſe in both of them (I ſcarce know in how many more you do the like) you have taken diligent pains (forſooth) in ſearching into the Original of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place, and the chief, which I take notice of as worthy of commendation in this way, is in <hi>pag.</hi> 322. &amp; 323. of your Book; where you do deſcant prettily upon the Apoſtles word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 4. 18. to draw the emphaſis of it to your own ends; neither will I quarrel with you about the force of the word which you do obſerve there, nor will ſtand to diſpute either with you or againſt you, in what you chiefly aim at there, (though I cannot but tell you that I think it a hard ſaying, to aver as you do in the page before, that there is no command in the Scripture to make Gods glory the end of our ſalvation. I had thought, that in that place <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4. which is the place now comes readieſt in my mind, there had been a virtual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to make the glory of God the end of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for if God made himſelf and his own glory the end of all his works, ſince he hath made all for for himſelf, then methinks that thereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to aim at the ſame end with him, in all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:120067:48"/>
that concerns us, and chiefly in our Salvation; yea it ſeems to me a command of the Law, and light of nature it ſelf, that the main end of the Creature, in all things, even in its own happineſs; for as all happineſs, and good cometh from the Creator, ſo all happineſs and good ſhould tend to him chiefly as the end, and terminate in him, and his glory principally; but I will make me no more diſpute about that,) onely I do take notice of, and commend there, (in that your application of that word of the Apoſtles, to the ſcope you aim at) your ſatyrical irony of thoſe below you in knowledge, whom you do with much gravity and majeſty inſtruct thus: <hi>But I would that ſuch wiſe ones, ſay you, would ſeriouſly peruſe that place of Scripture,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 18, <hi>&amp;c. And that withal they would peruſe the original, or at leaſt, ſuffer themſelves to be informed, touching the word in the original, which is tranſlated, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, I do commend, or at leaſt, I do not much diſapprove in you, that you do thus keep up the authority of the original, and of your ſelf, who knows ſo well the original, to inform thoſe that are ignorant of it with ſuch majeſtick gravity, and not without a ſatyrick irony, calling them, wiſe ones forſooth, who in your account there, are but meer dunces, dolt-heads, or block-heads, even <hi>Antimonian Aſſes.</hi> I ſay again, I do not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſapprove that <hi>ſatyr-ironico-peremptory</hi> way of dictating your knowledge in the original, to the ſimpletons that are ignorant of it, upon this ground and reaſon, if it were for no other, that I know you are not ignorant of the rule, nor are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:120067:49"/>
not unaccuſtomed to the practiſe of it; to wit that you do to others, and deal with others, as you would have others do to you, and deal with you; and that you do contentedly receive your ſelf, ſuch a meaſure from others, as you do make out unto others your ſelf; (I profeſs really I am ſo, freely, in ſuch caſes as thoſe, well enough pleaſed to be told of my miſtakes, as I do tell others pleaſed to be told of my miſtakes, as I do tell others of theirs:) So that now, I do hope, you will not take it in evil part, if you be informed your ſelf, by others; as you your ſelf do inform others, of ignorance or miſtakes in the original and that with a ſatyrick irony (ſometimes) when it is dely deſerving, (as you do here, becauſe you think ſo much is deſerved:) Although ſuch a wiſe one as your ſelf, be joyned with another ſuch a wiſe one, as hath an Eagles-eye in his force-head, if both you, and he be in the ſame miſtake about the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: Methinks I hear you ſay, yes, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, at leaſt, I ſay, that you muſt ſay ſo, if you ſpeak any thing equitably, according to the rules above mentioned, and to the Law called, <hi>Lex talionis;</hi> like for like, is equitable.

                  <p>But, Sir, I have one queſtion to poſe you with, before I leave it: I pray, Sir, why do you not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form others, as well, and as ſharply alſo, about the force and emphaſis of the original words of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the Old Teſtament, as you do of the <hi>Greek</hi> in the new? is not the one as well

Why ſhould not then, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be able to inform firſt themſelves, and then teach their people out the <hi>Hebrew</hi> original in the Old Teſtament, as well as out of the <hi>Greek</hi> in the New? eſpecially ſeeing, that, for the inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble emphaſis, and ineffable force of the words, and their copiouſneſs in ſignifications, and for ſo much of Divine Majeſty imprinted upon the whole body of the Language, as it lieth in the Books of the Old Teſtament, it doth go a thouſand times beyond all the Languages of the World beſides: (Although the <hi>Greek,</hi> ſo much of it as is in the New Teſtament, being the Word of God, is of equal authority to the Old.)</p>
                  <p>Should you, Sir, being a Miniſter of the Word of God; ſhould you, I ſay, half that Word of your Maſter in your pains and ſtudy about it; ſhould you not account and challenge your ſelf, as but half a Miniſter, if you have negligently or careleſly done ſo? Is he any thing to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, but as half a Meſſenger or Ambaſſador,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:120067:50"/>
that knows and underſtands but half of his Lord or Soveraigns Ambaſſage or Commiſſion? Or is he a fit Ambaſſador, that can neither read with his own eyes, nor underſtand his Soveraigns Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Inſtructions intruſted unto him; or but the half of them? unleſs by the eyes, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and words of a Tranſlator, or an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter? What knows he, but his Interpreter may either ignorantly, or wilfully erre in delivery of his Soveraigns will and pleaſure?</p>
                  <p>I wiſh, Sir, from the bottom of my heart, that theſe conſiderations were more ſeriouſly (by far) laid to heart, then they are; for are not Miniſters Ambaſſadors of God in Chriſt? And again, I ſay, ſhould not an Ambaſſador know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Soveraigns will and pleaſure, in his Lords own words, and not by an Interpreter or Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor onely? Yes, Sir, they ſhould; and it is their great ſin and fault, if they uſe not all the means that providence affords them for that end; as he would be a moſt unreaſonable man, to be an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador for a King or State, who would not uſe the means the King or State would appoint him, of purpoſe to teach him the Language, which their Inſtructions muſt be given and delivered in: What if ſuch an unreaſonable man did take ſo unreaſonable an Ambaſſage, and went therewith to trade with Foreigners, and Enemies perhaps to his Maſter and Kingdom. And ſuppoſe again, that one of the Adverſaries (if it were but ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ignorance) did ſtep out, and alledg, it was not his Maſters Commiſſion he delivered, and that the Articles were otherwiſe ſtated and ſenſed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:120067:50"/>
in the original copy, then he did underſtand by the tranſlation of them; and if he did put him indeed to the trial of the original, how would not ſuch an Ambaſſador be aſhamed and nonpluſt? It fears me Sir, that this ſhall be both your own caſe and your Eagle-ey'd Patrons, ere it be long; and if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be ſo, I hope you do remember (<hi>Sir</hi>) that <hi>ſuch wiſe ones muſt ſuffer themſelves to be informed about the Original,</hi> where they do either miſtake it, or are ignorant of it.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, (now I think on't) I told you there were two places in your little Book, which I liked better then many others in your Book beſides. One of them I have already given you, with my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on't to be made uſe of as need requires. The other followeth, and that is <hi>pag:</hi> 148. &amp; 149. A paſſage you have there, liking me no leſs then the former; and in this it liketh me better, that it is out of the Old Teſtament, and that you do take notice of a very remarkable obſervation, (I wiſh you had always ſo remembred, and bethought your ſelf ſo ſeriouſly as to have remembred it, where-ever there were occaſion:) which is this, Sir; That one and the ſame word in the Hebrew is many times differently rendred by our Tranſlators. By the <hi>face</hi> of God, is ſometimes (ſay ye) meant his <hi>favor;</hi> and ſo it is taken <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. 11. it being the ſelf-ſame word in the Original, (excellently well and emphatically obſerved!) as is uſed <hi>ver.</hi> 9. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be differently rendred by our Tranſlators, (better yet remarked!) <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>v. 9. face,</hi> in <hi>v. 11. preſence.</hi> So then I ſee (<hi>Sir</hi>) and I do heartily commend you for it, that you do think it deſerves
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:120067:51"/>
to be taken notice of, where the Tranſlators do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly render the Original, or do differ in one place from their tranſlation of the ſame word in another place: And ſo ye do think. I ſuppoſe likewiſe, that it ſhould be obſerved, when they give divers words in the Hebrew one and the ſame tranſlation. And all thoſe (<hi>Sir</hi>) and many others, and ſuch like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties in the tranſlation, (as when in one and the ſelf-ſame place they do give different or divers readings of the Hebrew words or phraſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I think are neceſſarily to be diligently ſearched into, and compared with the Original, before a man can be rightly termed an Interpreter of the Word, for the ſatisfaction either of himſelf or his hearers.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, Sir, if you fail to be ſo accurate in your obſervations between the Tranſlation and the Original hereafter, eſpecially if there be more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of accuracie in obſervation then is here; for the truth is, I ſee little either of neceſſity or perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of ſuch accuracie here, it being a buſineſs that a hundred have in their mouths and put in books, that never knew a word in the Original, that the ſame word in the Hebrew is tranſlated ſometimes <hi>face,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>preſence;</hi> or ſome ſuch common and triſting expreſſions, which they have ſomewhere catcht to make uſe of, thereby to bear the world, and their hearers or readers in hand, that they are expert (forſooth) in the Hebrew cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſms. But, I ſay, all is well, if you be always as accurate in your explications of the Original, and comparing it with the Tranſlation, when places occur of ſome more material conſequence to be opened: But I fear me, Sir, it prove far otherwiſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:120067:51"/>
with you, and that you have been more accurate (I know not upon what account) in this punctilio, when no need required it, (except to ſhew that you had ſomething really of that which you would be aſhamed the world ſhould know that you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of; I ſay, I fear you have been more exact here, and that unneceſſarily) then ever I ſhall find you all your book over again, even there where you bring Texts of Scripture to prove your opinions in matters controverted, and in diſpute with your adverſaries. If this prove not true, Sir, then I have loſt my conjecturing faculty in ſuch like caſes; and if it do prove true, then I hope you will remember, that ſuch wiſe ones muſt ſuffer themſelves to be informed about the Original, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus (<hi>Sir</hi>) I have done with the firſt part of that equitable eſtimate I put upon your writings, having declared what I think praiſe-worthy in ſome paſſages of them, and how far. The other part of my eſtimate followeth, which I hope you will not take in ill part, ſince I have put that which ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commends you before, and have ſhewed <hi>quam ſtrenue,</hi> how manly you have behaved your ſelf in thoſe praiſe-worthy paſſages; and withall I have had obſervations upon them, ſo clearly ariſing from them, that they muſt ſeveral times be made uſe of particularly as we go on.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore I come to declare unto you ſome paſſages which did not a little offend, and diſlike me; ſome of which being altogether falſhoods, and thoſe in this matter are not ſmall ones, aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch things to be in the Word of God, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:120067:52"/>
are not in them; others are meer needleſs imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences, or groſs miſtakings; all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying, and be-ſpeaking aloud, Sir, that ſuch a wiſe one muſt ſuffer himſelf to be informed about the words in the original, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some of thoſe miſtakings are ſingly and onely your own; others are common to your ſelf, and your ſharp-ſighted Patron, under the ſame culpable miſtaking or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance with you, and therefore he alſo muſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be informed about thoſe his errors in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
                  <p>The firſt place then, that be-ſpeaks to me here, a neceſſity in you of information about the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, I did finde by caſting my eye upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the very Page going before your ſo exact Explication of the original, in reference to the tranſlation, which we touched laſt; to wit, <hi>Page</hi> 128. where the truth is, Sir, (I muſt tell you in the entrance again, and put you in minde of it, that I muſt ſpeak my thoughts freely to you, what ever they be, as I have a reaſonable occaſion; and therefore I ſay, that in the forecited place) you have one, not onely of the groſſeſt miſtakes, that I think was ever put in a Print Book, but alſo one of the moſt impertinent falſhoods; putting that upon, and in the words of God, by one of his Prophets, that there is not the leaſt ſhew, nor appearance of, nay, that there is the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary evidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken in the words themſelves, and, which is worſt of all, in the tranſlation alſo; ſo that I profeſs, Sir, I wonder not a little how ſuch a miſtake ſhould have ariſen in a rational head; you are for your own ends, in the Page
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:120067:52"/>
inſtanced before, explaining what is meant in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by the face of God, which ſometimes is put, ſay you, for the favour of God, and ſometimes for the wrath, and diſpleaſure of God; and here we are directed with a reference to the Margent, where you do place, as a ſpecial obſervation, theſe words, <hi>In this ſenſe the face of God,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is ſometimes ſtiled the back of God, Jer.</hi> 18. 17.</p>
                  <p>When I did caſt my eye upon your words, I thought ſomewhat ſtrange of them, for I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver remembred, that ever I had obſerved any ſuch expreſſion, as that ſhould import the face of God to be ſtiled the back of God: And I thought I did ow you thanks for ſhewing me ſuch a phraſe, if there were indeed any ſuch; I did preſently, therefore, turn to the place, and there, I profeſs, I was amazed at the miſtake; for I did not onely ſee nothing ſuch there. but the quite contrary, for the words in themſelves are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

Here, I ſay, I did finde nothing ſuch, as the face of God ſtiled the back of God, but the quite contrary, if any thing at all ſuch: For firſt, the word <hi>back</hi> is not in that Text at all, but the word <hi>neck,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>gnoreph</hi> doth onely ſignifie the <hi>neck;</hi> the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph</hi> in the Radical ſignification of it, importing to cut off the neck, as it were, that is, to behead:

                     <hi>gab,</hi> being onely uſed for that.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither the face of God, nor the neck of God, is expreſly in the Text; but the words may carry this ſenſe; <hi>In the day of my peoples calamity, when I do ſcatter them as with an eaſt-wind before their enemies,</hi> (which are the words immediately before in the ſame verſe,) then <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>velo panim,</hi> and not the <hi>face</hi> (of my people) when I ſhall make my people flee before their enemies. The latter part of the verſe being taken as another explication of the former part of the verſe; this being alſo a moſt uſual expreſſion to expreſs the running away from purſuing enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by turning their hinder parts, and not their breaſt or face to their adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>But, 3. though both we ſhould take the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>gnoreph</hi> to be tranſlated (in ſenſe at leaſt) the <hi>back;</hi> and that we ſhould take the words as ſpoken of the <hi>face</hi> of God, and <hi>back</hi> of God, as <hi>I</hi> think it is moſt probable they ſhould be ſo taken; yet I ſay here is no ſtiling the <hi>face</hi> of God to be the <hi>back</hi> or <hi>neck</hi> of God; but as I ſaid, the quite contrary; the <hi>face</hi> is oppoſite to the <hi>neck</hi> or <hi>back</hi> of God; as is obvious to the conſideration of any at the very firſt rational view of the words, or but hearing them read, thus: <hi>I will make them to ſee</hi> (what? not my face ſtiled my back, but) <hi>my back,</hi> (or the back of my diſpleaſure and ſad afflicting diſpenſations) <hi>and not my face</hi> (or the face of my favor and favorable mercies.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:120067:53"/>The truth is, Sir, I did run every where in my thoughts, and <hi>I</hi> looked round about me to ſeek a ſhift for you here, and <hi>I</hi> could find none. For firſt, as to the Tranſlation, although <hi>I</hi> knew you before to be ſo excellent a Textuary-Divine as to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, that you can accurately teach us, that the ſame word in the Hebrew is ſometimes rendred <hi>face,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>preſence;</hi> and that therefore you could notſatisfie your ſelf with the tranſlation, if it did vary from the original: And yet although you your ſelf, I did ſee, in this place, did differ ſo much from your ſelf, in that place about <hi>face</hi> and <hi>preſence,</hi> in the very next page, as that <hi>I</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Tranſlation could not favor you in ſuch nonſenſe; yet I did take it, and I did ſee it (as it could not rationally otherwiſe be but) quite againſt you; theſe being the words of the Tranſlators, <hi>I will ſhew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity:</hi> where the oppoſition is clearly kept, as in the original, ſo in the tranſlation, between the <hi>face</hi> or favor of God, and his <hi>back</hi> or diſpleaſure; but not the <hi>face</hi> of God ſtiled the <hi>back</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, becauſe I did ſuppoſe that ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate a piece as your Exercitation, could not be ſuppoſed to be ſent abroad in the world, without the Authors review to take notice of eſcapes after the Preſs, therefore I did hafte to turn over to the <hi>Errata</hi> at the end of the Book; but there I did ſee a number of literal faults corrected, moſt of which any that can underſtand Engliſh would have eaſily paſt over without ſcarce taking notice of them; but of this material error and groſs miſtake of the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>quidem,</hi> not ſo much as a ſyllable of that there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:120067:54"/>Thirdly, I did ſuppoſe, that poſſibly it might be, (though truly I believe ye would not, or at leaſt I think you ought not to have been ſo careleſs, if it poſſibly could have been helped, yet I did feign to my ſelf that it might be) you had not ſeen your ſheets after the Preſs, and that therefore yet it had been a fault of Correctors at the work it ſelf there where it was a doing, and that they might have paſſed over ſome material fault in the work; yet afterwards when I conſidered the words, I could not poſſibly imagine how the miſtake of the Printers could have been, unleſs they had purpoſely done it, and in ſtead of ſaying, that the <hi>face</hi> of God is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>back</hi> of God, they had knowingly put in ſuch nonſenſe, that the <hi>face</hi> of God is ſtiled the <hi>back</hi> of God; which I ſuppoſe no Printer dared to do, or would have done.</p>
                  <p>Yet fourthly, imagining again that a word might have been changed either knowingly or ignorantly, willingly or unwillingly, poſſibly or impoſſibly, by ſome one or another, without the Authors know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; yet when I look back to the Original again, I did ſee it evidently contradict that imagination of mine, and manifeſtly to clear unto me that the fault could lie no where but upon the Author's own ſcore, in the ſupine negligence of ſtudy and ſearch into, and the groſs ignorance of the Original text of the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>For, Sir, you do bring this place of Scripture to prove, that the <hi>face</hi> of God is ſometimes taken in Scripture for the <hi>wrath</hi> and diſpleaſure of God: Whereas any in the world that hath any ſpark of ſenſible reaſon in them, at the firſt hearing of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120067:54"/>
words, even in the tranſlation of them, will clearly perceive that by the <hi>face</hi> of God here is meant his <hi>favorable countenance,</hi> or merciful diſpenſations; and by his <hi>back</hi> is meant his diſpleaſure and juſt judgments; becauſe the Prophet threatneth them thus, <hi>I will ſhew them the back, and not the face.</hi> So that this is not blind ignorance of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal only, but intolerable miſtaking of the meaning and words even of the Tranſlation it ſelf. I do profeſs I know not what to call it; only this I am ſure of, that you are intrapped and caught without any evaſion or way to eſcape, in one of the greateſt, groſſeſt, and moſt ignorant miſtakings, that ever a Miniſter or Ambaſſador of God (<hi>quoad nomen</hi>) was taken in or catched, in interpreting a Text of any of his Scriptures. And I hope, Sir, you are a wiſe one, that will willingly ſuffer your ſelf to be informed about the words in the Original, when they are miſtaken: You know, Sir, how you uſe to inform others your ſelf, and you know your ſelf well enough, when you know you can inform them.</p>
                  <p>But yet, now that (that which you may call) my paſſion is over, (for indeed I was offended with you in your miſtake) methinks there is yet an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion left for you, by which you may eſcape the challenge laid againſt you; and that therefore there hath been too great rigor uſed unto you. And the evaſion may perhaps help you at a dead lift; for it is ſuch a one indeed, that I know a man that hath no leſs then Eagles eyes in his head, <hi>Sir,</hi> as you think, who does ſee it ſo fit for his purpoſe, as that he frequently makes very much uſe of it, if he be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:120067:55"/>
challenged with errors and miſtakes in his Tenets; and it may be that he may make uſe of it to ſhelter you from the ſtorms that ſeem here to be blown againſt you, as I am ſure it is a ſhield to himſelf to keep off many blows that would fall heavily upon him if he lacked it.</p>
                  <p>And the way to eſcape is this, <hi>Sir,</hi> or at leaſt it may be thought to be ſo; to wit, That it may be ſaid and conceived you did not ſpeak ſo much your own opinion concerning the words of the Text above rendred, as that you had what you ſpake about the words from another hand, and ſo they were as much the words of another as your own which you ſpake.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, <hi>Sir,</hi> as to that I ſay, That that is the moſt ſophiſtical and jugling way of ſpeaking, that ever any free, rational, or ingenious man did ſpeak in, (nay which doth not become ſuch a one to ſpeak ſo at all) if he doth not expreſly manifeſt whether he do own or not, and how far he owns, or how far he diſowns the words which he relateth: For unleſs he do ſo, no man can take hold upon what he ſaith; for always he will have a back-door to get out at, whenſoever he fears to be nonpluſt and ſilenced; then will he ſay, he ſpoke that but as the mind of others, whatever he meant of that, or of any other thing beſides that before.</p>
                  <p>But again <hi>Sir,</hi> if either you your ſelf, or he for you, will uſe this ſhift, to free you in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, between you and me at this time, then I have two things to ſay, to ſtop either or both your mouths, with either of them; and the firſt is this, That if ever you produce an intelligent Author,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:120067:55"/>
underſtanding the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, that doth ſenſe or non-ſenſe the words in controverſie, in your way, I ſhall be the firſt that ſhall challenge my ſelf, as having with a too virulent Pen carped at your miſtaken Criticiſm; and I ſhall humbly and heartily crave your pardon for it; and that you may oblige me by my promiſe, and acknowledged duty, to do ſo, Sir, if you can, I intreat you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one unto me, by your next: In the mean time ſecondly, I will tell you and your friend, That if you do produce any ſuch nonſenſical bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, that doth ſay that in thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Erem gnoreph velo panim,</hi> I will cauſe them to ſee, or I will ſhew them the (neck or) back, and not the face; the face of God is ſtiled the back of God, then I will anſwer, Sir, if you think to evade and eſcape that way, that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is as bad, and worſe then the diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the remedy then would be the cauſe of the diſeaſe. For this is your ſin, and this is your ſhame, That you have nothing of underſtanding, and knowing your Maſters own words, but onely an implicite faith, to take upon truſt your tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors words; ſo that if any one whom you take to be your Interpreter, ſpeak non-ſenſe before you, then you your ſelf do know nothing, but to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and to dictate non-ſenſe with him.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I will conclude this firſt place, Sir, by telling you laſtly, and minding you ſeriouſly of it; that into danger of ſuch inextricable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perplexities, doth that man put himſelf to, who runneth as a Meſſenger and Ambaſſador about his acknowledged Lord and Maſters buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

and yet knoweth not (underſtandingly) to read his Maſters Commiſſion, and his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the proper Language in which his Lord did deliver them to him:</p>
                  <p>I have done now, Sir, with the firſt Text of Scripture in your Exercitation, much miſapplied in proſecution of your Tenets: and I have a little more fully deſcanted about it, firſt, becauſe it was a (groſly) material miſtake; ſecondly, becauſe I would in one place put ſeveral of my thoughts, that in ſeveral ſuch caſes afterwards, they may be reflected and looked upon here, as if they were juſt repeated over again in the ſame, or ſuch like words, when the like need or occaſion requires: And thirdly, this I did here ſo largely, that hence I might be more brief in proſecuting the reſt of thoſe miſapplications and miſconſtructions of other Texts of Scripture, which I have marked in your Book; yea, I do reſolve to be now as brief as I can, in all the reſt of the places that I ſhall take notice, (becauſe I am not well contented, that Epiſtolary lines are drawn by my hand to ſuch a length, as I ſee they are;) onely, Sir, remember that by an equitable rule you muſt ſuffer your ſelf to be informed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>ABout the beginning of your Book, when I firſt peruſed it, there were ſeveral places which I did mark, as impertinent and inconſiderate Applications of ſome Texts, with ſuch miſtakings as did bewray indeed, little knowledge or ſtudy in the original; but yet not ſo groſs and abſurd ignorance as the firſt, which is already paſt over. Now as I am looking out thoſe marks which I had laid in your Book, the firſt day I did ſee it, I caſt my eye upon a paſſage of yours, which I had marked, indeed, but had quite forgot when I did preſent to your view thoſe two paſſages which I did ſo much commend, and count praiſe-worthy in your Exercitation: For if I had minded it, it would have been as highly commended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by me, as the other two, or at leaſt, I am ſure, it had been joyned to them as a fellow for a third. The paſſage is this, Sir, <hi>Page</hi> 11. wherein your Obſervations upon the Negative phraſes, uſed in Scripture about forgiveneſs of ſins, this you put down as one of the chief, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on of any other I do take notice of there, to wit, onely let it be noted, ſay you, concerning the two laſt places, <hi>viz. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16. and <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60. That albeit the phraſe in the tranſlation be all one, (both being rendred a not laying ſin to the charge of the ſinner;) nevertheleſs the phraſes in the original are diverſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where you go on to paraphraſe the two places in the original, and to collation them together; <hi>Probe factum,</hi> ſay I, <hi>accuratiſſime functus es officio, Reverendiſſime domine:</hi> Excellently well obſerved and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,

Sir, <hi>in tantum,</hi> and ſo far, at leaſt. But hark you, I did once poſe you with a queſtion, which hath not well been anſwered as yet unto me, as I think, I know not if it will be. Why do you not as pathetically comment and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the original in the Old Teſtament; diſtinguiſhing it, as it is in it ſelf, and as it is phraſified in the tranſlation? Is it becauſe there is not ſo much matter to work upon that way, in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as there is in the <hi>Greek?</hi> No, Sir, you cannot ſay ſo, for there is a thouſand times more in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as it is a Language, by the acknowledgement of all, that ever underſtood any thing ſolidly in it. Why then are you not as accurate in ſtudy and diligence about the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> and more then about the <hi>Greek?</hi> Well, perhaps it may be ſo compleat a Divine is. Let us go to it, and try then.</p>

And amongſt thoſe, firſt, out of one Text, you give us one form of expreſſion of the Spirit of God, which you ſay is, <hi>take away all iniquity;</hi> when that is not the form of expreſſion uſed in that place of Scripture, to wit, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. but this, <hi>cauſe thou iniquity to paſs by,</hi> or <hi>make thou iniquity to paſs over.</hi> And ſecondly, with this Text, and the form of phraſe and expreſſion uſed in it, you give us another Text, which you ſay hath the ſame form of phraſe and expreſſion with the other, when it is not the ſame, but different from it, to wit, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. where the form of expreſſion uſed. is not, <hi>cauſe thou iniquity to paſs over,</hi> which was the former, but this, <hi>lift thou up,</hi> or <hi>carry ſin away,</hi> as was ſaid before in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe two Roots. Is this, Sir, to ſhew as great diligence and care in ſearching and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> original of the Old Teſtament, and to comment and paraphraſe upon it, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing

it in its difference, and varietie, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in its ſeveral phraſes and forms of expreſſion with the tranſlation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, Sir, do you thus ſhew your ſelf as knowing and diligent to do in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as you uſe to do, and we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you to do in the <hi>Greek</hi> original of the New Teſtament? if you do it onely thus, I ſhall not expect to hear any accurate Explication of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> from you at all, after this. If there be ſaid in your behalf, any thing from the tranſlation, then I will reply, that your obſervation about the <hi>Greek</hi> did run thus, I wiſh ſuch wiſe-ones would peruſe the original, or at leaſt ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be informed, that the word is ſo and ſo in the original, though it be rendred ſo and ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the tranſlation; and that it is to be noted, That although in ſeveral places the tranſlation be diverſe, yet the word or phraſe in the original is one and the ſame; and ſo though the tranſlation in divers places be the ſame, yet the words and phraſes in the original are different, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such and ſuch like are your accurate &amp; critical obſervations upon the original, and tranſlation of the New Teſtament: But none ſuch are here upon the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and tranſlation of the Old Teſtament, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I remember once you were pleaſed to dictate to us, that in two places of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. the ſame word in the original was tranſlated in the ninth Verſe, <hi>preſence,</hi> and in the eleventh Verſe, <hi>face;</hi> a pretty (or petty) obſervation indeed: But I doubt, I ſhall not in haſte finde the like from you again; but on the quite contrary, I doubt not, but I ſhall always (hereafter) finde from you but juſt

ſuch pitiful ſtuff as I finde here, that is nothing, when ever ye touch the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, wilful, negligent, or careleſs miſtakings of the original. And I fear, nay, I know, the event will prove in our progreſs, the thing to be true, that here I conjecture; ſo that there will nothing remain, but that you muſt ſuffer your ſelf to be informed, when you are in miſtakes about the original; as about the end of that third Chapter of your Exeration, <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. you fall juſt into ſuch another miſtake as we had laſt in hand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying your far leſs knowledge, diligence, and ſtudy, in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> then in the <hi>Greek.</hi> For in theſe two laſt pages of your third Chapter, your ſcope is to enumerate ſo many diverſe Negative phraſes in Scripture, about Gods not forgiving and pardoning ſin; and amongſt thoſe diverſe phraſes, differing one from another in form of words, you make your ſecond phraſe to be Gods, <hi>not holding guiltleſs,</hi> in the Third Commandment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7. to which you adde, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 9.

                  <p>Alas, Sir, thus it is to declare your Lord and Maſters Commiſſion and Inſtructions to you, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a tranſlating Interpreter; not underſtanding the words of your own commiſſion your ſelf: Your Interpreters may make you believe any thing they pleaſe, they may cauſe you believe that to be the ſame, which is not the ſame, that to be diverſe, which is not diverſe, that to differ, which doth not differ, and that to agree, which doth not agree, and that to be an article of your commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by an inſtruction to you, which is not an article of your commiſſion, nor an inſtruction to you at all.

                  <p>Theſe eſcapes, Sir, in the beginning of your Book, with the notice taken thus of them, I was the more willing, with all the haſt I poſſibly could, that they ſhould come into your hands; it being but a fort-night by-gone, yeſterday, ſince I did firſt, either ſee, or hear of your Book: And after I had once run over it; the day I ſaw it, I did not for nine days following, look upon it more; nor all that time had I leiſure to begin to write a word of this miſſive, directed to your great friend and your ſelf: Yet when I did begin, I ſay, for to write unto you, I willingly would not leave off, till I had put a period to the courſe of my thoughts at this time, eſpecially about advertiſing you, as I have ſaid, about your eſcapes in the beginning of your Book; becauſe in the end of it, I do ſee, that you notifie unto us a deſign of a ſecond part to this Treatiſe, in which you do propoſe to your ſelf, to communicate unto us thoſe ſeveral phraſes both of the Old and New Teſtament, which you take to be ſynonimous, and equivalent to forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, Sir, how is it poſſible that you can take upon you to do ſo much, ſo daringly? What, Sir, to finde out and ſet down thoſe ſeveral phraſes in the Old Teſtament, which you take to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Theſe advertiſements I deſire you timouſly and ſeriouſly to think upon, before that ſecond Tractate of yours, that ſo you do not any more expoſe your ſelf to obloquies and reproaches for your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and others to pains in correcting of them.</p>

carry this embaſſage: And ſuppoſe that one were obtruded as moſt accompliſht for this employment, as having, 1. more ſharpneſs of wit then is in an Eagles eye, to pierce and to pry into the principles and affections of people, to wed them to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters intereſt; and 2. as having a deep underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a profound judgment, with moſt ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſcuſs all principles of State-policie; and 3. as being excellently well acquainted with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the State and people the embaſſage is to be directed unto, ſo that he can diſcourſe with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable eloquence and underſtanding therein. Theſe three qualifications in ſo eminent a degree, would perhaps draw the eyes of all to look upon this man, as indeed the (only) man for ſuch an employment; until that one thing come to be objected as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to this mans preferment, which makes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a little demur about the buſineſs. And the obſtacle (in my thoughts a main one) is this; That ſuch a man, though never ſo well accompliſht every other way, yet he is altogether ignorant of the language in which the Embaſſage, and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Kings Commiſſion is ſealed up, and originally written in.</p>
                  <p>If I were <hi>apud Regem à conſiliis ejus,</hi> and in this caſe ſitting at or ſtanding by beſides the Kings Council-table, this one obſtacle were enough to draw from me a publique and free diſſenting voice, or a ſecret diſſwading ſuggeſtion from the choice of this ſo great a man, notwithſtanding of all his other abilities, as the abſolutely fitteſt for ſuch a function. Yet notwithſtanding of my judgment, though it would be backed perhaps by divers others
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120067:62"/>
that were there, ſuppoſe that the plurality of voices went upon his ſide, and he were actually choſen, in conſideration of his great endowments, and upon this ground, That notwithſtanding he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant himſelf of that language which his Maſters em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage was writ in, yet there was a Tranſlation of his Commiſſion and Inſtructions ſent abroad in the Country for the ſatisfaction of the body of the people, about the grounds he was ſent to treat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that that Tranſlation, for the main bulk and body of it in general, was competently ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in rendring the original Copy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for the ſubſtance of it, obvious to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the common and unletter'd people; and that therefore it would be ſufficient enough for a man ſo well qualified in all other abilities, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate his Commiſſion, and to diſpute about his Articles by, againſt all that could oppoſe him, in the vulgar language of the people he was ſent unto.</p>
                  <p>Well, upon this account he accepts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage and Commiſſion, takes the Tranſlation of it and the Articles thereof along with him, and gets him gone about the imployment. When he is arrived at the place he was ſent to, he is accepted with all the applauſe that confluences of people could create unto him, he is ſo expert in his way to inſinuate himſelf into peoples affections: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers there to the State he was ſent to, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Commiſſion, and that in their own language, in ſuch exquiſite terms of rational and oratory eloquence, that he is admired by ſome, high eſteemed by many, and very well accounted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:120067:62"/>
of for his accompliſht qualifications by all. In the mean time, he comes afterwards to diſpute about the State-controverſies anent the Articles of his Embaſſage; and here alſo he ſuppoſes himſelf, and is cryed up by others, as going beyond by far the moſt part of all his Antagoniſts, outreaching them all in ſharpneſs of ſight, as much and as far as the Eagles eye doth outreach the Night-owls: Till at length there falls in a controverſie to be diſputed between him and his adverſaries, which nothing could ſo well determine as the ſight and knowledg of his original papers for the articles of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and the queſtion it ſelf was no leſs mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial then this, <hi>Who were they that were threatned by his Maſters articles and laws in them contained, to be puniſhed as Traitors and Rebels?</hi> He did confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aver, and did undertake to prove it from his Maſters Writs, that all the whole Kingdom, both State and People, great and ſmall, good and bad, better and worſe, were threatned to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as no leſs then Traitors, for all their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
                  <p>This was thought ſtrange by the better ſort of that State and People, who not only really were, but did know themſelves to be great in his and their Soveraigns favor; and that according to thoſe very Patents of the King which he did bring with him, for inſtructions to treat about the articles of his embaſſie: Therefore they did adviſe him not to be too confident in his ſharpneſs of his ſight, about that point; for they would hardly believe it, though he would ſwear it, that their Lord and Maſter was either ſo changeable in himſelf, in the acts of his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:120067:63"/>
own Knowledg and Will, as he would aver, or that he did in his Laws ſo threaten them who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reconciled to him, and their ranſom or price of redemption paid unto him, as far as was fully ſatisfactory to juſtice, to the utmoſt farthing. They did acknowledg indeed, that they knew their Soveraigns pleaſure was ſuch, even as to them his reconciled and ranſomed ones, that if any of them did willingly tranſgreſs any ſtatutes of his, he would as a Father out of love reprove and chaſtiſe them, to reclaim them to walk in his ways again; but that ever he intended or threatned in his laws, properly to puniſh them as a Judg out of juſtice, that they did deny, and deſired him to conſider his articles better, before he did any more aſſert it. But he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d conſtantly continue peremptorily to aver, that all of the beſt of them were threatned in his Maſters articles properly to be puniſhed, even for their eſcapes and failings, out of infirmity of ſtrength to walk ſo warily as they would, conform to their Lords laws; (for he dared not freely and openly to affirm, (though he was ſhrewdly ſuſpected for holding the opinion of it) that any of ſuch recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled ones could ever become Traitors indeed, and obſtinate Rebels to their Lord and his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.)</p>
                  <p>Well, they did ſee they behoved to put him to it, and ſo they do. He ſaith, he will bring—I do not know how many Reaſons and Arguments to prove what he affirms. Nay, but ſay they, Sir, ſubtile Wits may frame very many ſubtile Arguments to prove any thing; and all of us have not Eagles eyes in our foreheads to pry into ſuch ſubtilties:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120067:63"/>
You muſt ſhew unto us our Lord and Maſters own Writs and Words for it, or elſe we will not give a ſtraw for your Ratiocinations, if they differ and diſagree from thoſe. Whereupon he produceth a number of places out of his tranſlated Commiſſion and Articles. Yea but, ſay they, thoſe will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us either, Sir; for thoſe are not our Lord and gracious Soveraigns own words nor writings; thoſe are but your copied out tranſlations, they are not his firſt and original words and writings.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon my Lord Ambaſſador is put to a ſtand with himſelf; and to wiſh, though too late, that another had now undertaken his buſineſs. To ſay that he knows not whether it be ſo in the Original or not, that he will not, becauſe he cannot for ſhame; for the higheſt of his admirers muſt cry <hi>out</hi> upon him then: What? one accounted to be ſo accompliſht an Ambaſſador, and yet knows not himſelf, and by his own eyes (though never ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted in other things, what then? ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with another mans eyes and knowledg) read underſtandingly his own Commiſſion and his Maſters own words in the articles of his ambaſſage? Did any ever hear or read of ſuch an Ambaſſador? If he be befooled by, his Interpreters, he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool us in all that concerns us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like thoughts will make my Lord Ambaſſador, nill he, or will he, to produce his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; and when they are produced, if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found in them to prove what's in queſtion, and what he did ſo confidently aſſert to be; nay upon the contrary, if in thoſe very words which he doth alleadge to prove, that his Lords laws do
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:120067:64"/>
threaten the better ſort of his Subjects and moſt obedient, for their offences, with puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, as of juſtice, and as a Judg, and not only with loving chaſtiſements as a Father; if in thoſe very words, I ſay, which he brings to prove this, it be expreſly threatned only to chaſtiſe them, how would ſuch an Ambaſſador look, and what thoughts would he himſelf and all others have of his raſh undertaking?</p>
                  <p>I leave it to your ſelf, Sir, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to think and conſider ſeriouſly upon it; for you are the two Ambaſſadors by name, whom I do point at, in all this long ſtoried ſuppoſition, of a caſe you may think perhaps in an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> State, or in the world of the Moon: No, good Sir, you are both miſtaken; for I have inſiſted a little the longer upon it, becauſe I think the ſubſtance thereof is of great concernment, and may be of much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence then either you or I are aware of at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if ſeriouſly laid to heart and conſidered; as likewiſe becauſe, as to greatneſs of diſtance from your particular concernment, it reacheth and goeth no farther, Sir, then <hi>Kederminſter</hi> in <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Stanton</hi> in <hi>Wilts,</hi> and the Preachers at thoſe places: Thoſe are the two, Sir, who take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as Ambaſſadors of Chriſt to prove, that he and his law doth threaten Believers to puniſh their failings with that which is properly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proceeding from no leſs then the wrath and juſtice of God, as he is a wrathful Judge, and not only as a Father out of fatherly love to chaftiſe them with the rods of his mercy, to reclaim them; but even with vengeance, proceeding from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:120067:64"/>
his vindictive and revenging juſtice to puniſh them. Now (Sir) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath been more then once put to it to prove it, and both of you have done all that ye can to make good your opinion from your Maſters holy Writs, and from his Articles of inſtruction delivered unto you, to give out to his people: I will only peruſe them, and ſee if you have need to be informed about the Original of them: Yea, Sir, I have peruſed them already, and I do ſee that you needs muſt ſuffer your ſelves to be informed about the Original of them, inſomuch that you have miſapplied and groſly abuſed all and each of thoſe Texts of the Old Teſtament which you have brought to prove, that puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called is threatned to the offences of the Godly; when in not any one of them, puniſhment either proper or improper, is mentioned at all. This (Sir) I tell you I have tryed, and found to be true already; and now I have nothing to do but to inform your ſelves of it, and to give to any others that deſire to take notice of the queſtion, a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and information about it.</p>
                  <p>And (Sir) becauſe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth bring thoſe Scriptures which you alſo inſiſt upon, moſt ſuccinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt briefly, laying them all together <hi>in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:120067:65"/>This then, Sir, is one of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby he proves, that the afflictions or the ſufferings of the godly, are properly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>They are called puniſhments in Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and therefore we may call them ſo;</hi> and the ſame is your Argument alſo, Sir.</p>
                  <p>But here, I might firſt deny the conſequence, both to you and him; for the ſtrength of it lieth in this Propoſition, Whatſoever is attributed to any thing in Scripture, we may properly attribute the ſame unto it; or we may properly call any thing as it is called, and ſaid to be in Scripture: But this is not univerſally true: for hands and feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are attributed to God in Scripture; and yet we cannot properly attribute hands and feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to God, by averring, that ſuch corporeal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are properly in God: It were borrid blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to ſpeak ſo. Yet the ſtrength of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would fall to the ground, if it were for no more but this, as it might be proſecuted.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, my main buſineſs is to deny the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, or the firſt Propoſition, and to put you both to prove it, by averring and aſſerting in terms of contradiction to your Propoſition, That the Scripture doth not call the ſufferings or afflictions of believing and godly perſons, puniſhments: I ſay the Scripture cals them not puniſhments at all, either properly or improperly. Well, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> being put to it, as ſuſpecting it would be denied him, he proves it with a catalogue of ſeveral Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. I ſhall view them as he layeth them down, Sir, and I ſhall preſent both to your view and his what I do find in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:120067:65"/>The firſt place which he brings to prove that the afflictions of the Godly are called Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Scripture, is <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 41, &amp; 43. I have turned to theſe two verſes, and I find no ſuch thing in the words of God by his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> in thoſe Texts; nay, there is not ſo much as any mention made at all there of the word <hi>puniſhment:</hi> how can it then prove that the afflictions of the godly are not only chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but proper puniſhments?

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:120067:66"/>But you will ſay, the ſenſe muſt be ſupplied ſome way: And I grant, there muſt be ſome good ſenſe made, as far as we can, of all words of Scripture. But how? Muſt only the <hi>Baxte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> or <hi>Hotchkiſſian</hi> ſenſe be taken as good and orthodox, eſpecially of thoſe places of Scripture which they think may ſerve for their turns, when they have ſenſed them as they pleaſe? No Sir, we will not do ſo, except you could bring us to that ſtreight, that we could probably ſenſe them no other way then you do. But here the caſe is clear, that a ſenſe quite and clear contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting yours, as to the preſent queſtion, may be put upon the words, as well and as probably, if not more probably then yours; to wit, by ſupplying the word <hi>correction</hi> or <hi>chaſtiſement:</hi> And then the words will run thus; <hi>And if they accept of the</hi> chaſtiſement <hi>of their iniquity.</hi> And then where is your proof from this Text, that the afflictions of the Godly are not only cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, but proper puniſhments? Nay, from this Text, thus tranſlated, it is inferred againſt you, that they are chaſtiſements, and not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, becauſe the Scripture calls them not ſo. And yet you do ſay it does, Sir, and in this Text: but are you not aſhamed in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo?</p>
                  <p>And that this ſupplement of the Text by the word <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> is as probable as by <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and a great deal more probable, is to me paſt queſtion, if it were but upon this account; That no where elſe can you produce any place
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:120067:66"/>
or Text of Scripture, where the expreſs word <hi>puniſhment</hi> is attributed to the afflictions of the godly; but in very many places the word <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement</hi> or <hi>correction</hi> is attributed to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                  <p>Now which is moſt probable, the <hi>Baxterian</hi> ſenſe, by putting in a word to the Text that hath no parallel to it in all the Hebrew text, or by ſupplying the Text by a word that is often uſed elſwhere, when the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly to the point in queſtion. I profeſs, Sir, upon this one conſideration, I would count your ſenſe rather nonſenſe, then to put it before this ſenſe, which upon this ground, I ſay, is moſt probable; becauſe your ſenſe is ſupplied by a word no where in Scripture, and the other ſenſe is by a word frequently uſed in Scripture. If you do but ſo much as name the Tranſlation to me, Sir, or any thing from it, then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I'll name to you again what in the ſtory before is related in the caſe ſuppoſed, That all the people cry <hi>out</hi> upon my Lord Ambaſſador there, that his Lordſhip was but an Ambaſſador <hi>by name</hi> only, and no ways fit for the thing it ſelf, ſince he could only judg of his Soveraigns Inſtructions and Commiſſion unto him but by Tranſlations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sir, I'll freely tell you, that though I do as much eſteem of our lateſt Tranſlation as you or any can rationally do, accounting it better and much more accurate then I believe any vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tranſlation that is in the Chriſtian world;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:120067:67"/>
yet I muſt not take the Tranſlation that now is, nor no Tranſlation that can be made in the world by humane induſtry, to be my Original; that is, I muſt not go with the Tranſlation, to go againſt Reaſon with the Original, or to go againſt a more reaſonable and probable tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Original; as always I ſhall eſteem that to be, which is made up, where the ſenſe is doubtful, by adding to ſuch words as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to other parallel places of Scripture; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that which is framed of a word or words, which is no where extant in a parallel place to the Text in queſtion, although it ſhould have Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> approbation and Mr. <hi>Hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſs's</hi> both annexed unto it: But ſuch is the Tranſlation before approven; and therefore it is more rational and probable then the other, notwithſtanding both your authorities in back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>Thus (Sir) though you have not been adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of a long while now, yet I hope you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That ſuch wiſe ones muſt ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be informed about the Original, when they are ignorant of it, or in any great miſtake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it.

The onely thing you can ſay here is, that the whole lamentations, and ſo this place, is in the name of the whole Church; but be it ſo, yet your Antagoniſts can tell you, that in the whole Church there are bad as well good, yea many more bad then good; there are wicked as well as godly, yea too too many more wicked then God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; eſpecially when any Univerſal affliction is laid upon the whole Church, as here it was, when all of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:120067:72"/>
them were led captive, &amp; their land laid deſolate. Now Sir, they would tell you, that therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Text did mention proper puniſhments, as it doth mention no puniſhment at all; yet they would ſay, they were infflicted upon the Church for an Univerſal Deluge of wickedneſs which did overſpread the land and the outward face of the Church, but that yet notwithſtanding, theſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing ſtrokes of juſtice upon the whole land, and the wicked in it; were but chaſtizing corrections out of fatherly love, upon the perſons of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it; even amidſt all their common ſufferings with the wicked, in common calamities: and that therefore thoſe ſufferings of the Church and Land, were but to be called puniſhments, in reference to wicked, becauſe they were inflicted by God as a Judge out of juſtice upon them; but in reference to the perſons of the Godly, (in which relation the queſtion was ſtated) they were to be called but chaſtiſements of love; becauſe they did proceed from God as a Father in mercy to them.</p>
                  <p>Doth not Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> and you prove your points, excellently well Sir, when you bring a Text to prove that the afflictions of godly men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led properly puniſhments in Scripture, in which 1. there is not a word in that Text ſignifying puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. There is not a word in that Text ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying a godly man. And 3. when that we have ſuppoſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that you would have, to wit, that both theſe were in the Text, yet you do not prove your point; and if when we have gratified you with the ſuppoſition of all that you require, and yet you do not prove your points, I pray Sir tell me by

                     <hi>gnavon,</hi> puniſhment of iniquity; yet in the margent, they have put this note at that word, or iniquity; now what ſhal we ſay here for Mr. <hi>Baxter?</hi> did not he ſo much as ever look upon the Hebrew Bible, to ſearch if his proofs of his Tenets were clearly agreeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? if he never did, this is his great fault; yea his great ſhame, and his great ſin, that ſhould have been ſo many years ſo eminent a Miniſter and Embaſſadour of God to his people, and hath in thoſe years taken ſo much pains upon other ſtudies of all Sciences, in all Authors; and yet never did ſo much as apply himſelf with diligence to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Lord and Maſters Commiſſion, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles committed to him, in their own proper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but ſuppoſe he did not, but onely uſe the Tranſlators eyes, yet ſince there are Bibles of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts, had he never ſo much as a care to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to himſelf a Bible with the Marginal notes? if he never did, this was his further fault, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tends to his blame; if he did acquire ſuch a Bible with theſe Marginal notes, did he not make uſe of it when he made uſe of expounding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scriptures? if he did not ſo much as make uſe of that little help that was beſides him, (though ſmall in it ſelf, yet ſomewhat it is, and may be made good uſe of by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> underſtanding View<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it many times?) then I ſay his faulty neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:120067:76"/>
was greateſt of all in that, ſince he would not ſo much as look upon that little help which he had beſides him, underſtood, and might ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have uſed it; if he did look upon the Text, and ſee this reading upon the Margin; could he but know that that note imported, that that word might as well have been tranſlated iniquity, as the puniſhment of iniquity; if he conceived this much, then he could not but know, that then it was not a ſure place for him to make uſe of againſt his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, becauſe he could not but know, that if the word could be tranſlated either wayes, they would chooſe that way which was not againſt them, as well as he did that way which was for him; if he did know all this much, and yet would put down this place amongſt others, then I ſay his miſtake was willing and wilful and ſo the moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous of all; for hee both willingly did himſelf miſtake, and did willfully do what in him lay, to put his miſtake upon others; and that apparently with ſuch confidence, in his leading way; that he beleeved his approbations would bee taken for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and without any proof, (though there was as much reaſon againſt them as for them; as thoſe Marginal notes do import, that there is as much reaſon to tranſlate the one way as the other.)

here: But upon the other hand, if we tranſlate the words as they do of themſelves properly and radically offer themſelves to our conſideration, in their own proper, and radical ſignification thus, for the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater then the ſin of <hi>Sodom:</hi> Then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be ſuch, as when Chriſt ſaith, if the great works had been done in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> which have been done in thee, they had repented long ago, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, the ſins of the people of God, by reaſon of the great aggravations of them, againſt ſo great light and knowledge of God and his wayes revealed to them; againſt ſo many wondrous works done for them, amongſt them, and againſt their enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſins of the worſt of men, and may far goe beyond them in the compariſon.

thy peculiar people; but thou haſt onely afflicted us with chaſtiſements of mercy and fatherly love, as thou doeſt to all thy own children, from thy fatherly care of their future wel-being: And then Sir, they will ask you, where is your proof from theſe and ſuch like places of Scripture, that the ſufferings of the Godly are proper puniſhments? nay, they will further ask you, if that from thoſe ſame places which you bring to prove that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Godly are called proper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it may not rationally be deduced, that they are not proper puniſhments, from the juſtice of a judge, but onely chaſtiſements out of fatherly love; and if you ſay, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and you do ſenſe the places other ways, they will inſtantly reply, that (for all that they can ſee in your writings) the ſight and ſenſe of you both as to the point in queſtion, is but no ſight, or non-ſence, it being nothing at all in it ſelf, but onely by other mens Glaſſes; and this much, Sir, I think, may be rationally ſaid, to back the former accuſation, of miſtaking the original in this place; and as to the other part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> your negligent or willfull inconſideration of the tranſlation it ſelf; or your ſo ſuperficial look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorough that Glaſſe; I do conceive it moſt clearly thus to be by your ſelves bewrayed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in all the Engliſh Bibles with the Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal notes, at thoſe words in <hi>Ezra 9. 13. thou hast puniſhed us leſſe then our iniquities deſerve,</hi> there is this note put in the Margin; Heb. <hi>thou haſt with held below our iniquities,</hi> which import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that that is the formal, proper, and radical ſignification of the Hebrew words, and therefore

then the other, when the ſufferings of the Godly are ſpoken of; and when they have told you ſo much, then I have nothing more to tell you, but this, that thus ſuch wiſe ones muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be informed of the original by others, when they do not peruſe it themſelves.</p>

                  <p>And if this be not an excellent proof for an Embaſſador to prove that his Lord and Soveraign doth denounce in his word proper puniſhments, or that his Lord doth threaten that he wil (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) puniſh the beſt, and moſt obedient of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for their ſins' let the world judge, when (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Embaſſadors own acception of the words which be ſo much breaths after to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to him, and if it were granted) thoſe very words which he citeth, would bring in his Lord and Soveraign ſpeaking thus expreſly, I will not puniſh you at all, who deſire and endeavour to be my dutiful ſubjects: Although, indeed, I doe reſolve to correct you in meaſure, as a loving and merciful father doth his children for their offences.

failings, and faults; and that he will not hold them altogether guiltleſſe, by declaring (them altogether innocent, when they have offended againſt him but that rather he will by ſome diſpenſations of his providence, evidence to themſelves their own guiltyneſs, and manifeſt to the world his taking notice of it, after they have offended him by their ſins.</p>
                  <p>And this is all which can be made out from the proper and known ſignification of thoſe words: But when the queſtion is more particularly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, what are thoſe diſpenſations of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by which he notifyeth this his taking notice of the offences of the godly <hi>viz.</hi> Whether they be proper puniſhments proceeding from God as a judge out of juſtice and vindictive wrath or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; or whether they be onely fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections from God as a loving father, out of love and mercy, to reclaim his own from their ſinfull waies? I do think this a very ſcriptural reaſon, and Chriſtian-like anſwer, that if the Spirit of God in Scripture doth very frequently give out the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the godly by the name of chaſtiſements and corrections, but never by the name of (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) puniſhments, that then, the Saints ſufferings are (more ſcripturally at leaſt) to be called rather chaſtiſements and corrections, then (proper) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; but the antecedent or firſt propoſition is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture doth often call the ſufferings of the Saints corrections (as in thoſe very words of <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. 28. &amp; 30. 11. Yet I wil not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in meaſure: And (ſo ſhew that) I will not (altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:120067:88"/>
or) wholly hold thee guiltleſſe (<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is before explained) when thou doeſt ſin, and of fend me: but no where doth the Scripture call the Saints ſufferings (proper) puniſhments; (for if it doth, I deſire you would but inform me of it by your next, if you can, more fully and clearly then in this; and then I do promiſe you to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge my ſelf for challenging you as not being able to do it;) therefore the conſequent or the laſt propoſition is alſo true, <hi>viz</hi> that Chriſtians ought rather to call the Saints ſufferings, chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and corrections, then (proper) puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>The laſt two Texts which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> citeth, in that ſixth argument of his diſpute in his Aphoriſms, to prove that the ſufferings of the Godly are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (proper) puniſhments in Scripture; are out of <hi>Lev. 28. ver.</hi> 18. and 24.

And who likewiſe will not eaſily conjecture, that ſince the word to <hi>ſmite</hi> is as well applicable to the ſtrokes of chaſtiſement and correction out of fatherly love, as to the ſtrokes of puniſhing vengeance, or vindictive and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:120067:89"/>
revenging juſtice; that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Antagoniſts will make choice of the one, when the word is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the ſufferings of the Godly, as well as he doth the other, and that they will diſdain to weigh the weight of his authority to the contrary, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, that the word properly and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſignifying to correct or chaſtiſe, is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed in the Scripture to the diſpenſations of God to his people, when they offend him, as is often intimated before, and as we ſhall ſee, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below the proof of it; but never is there a word properly and radically ſignifying to puniſh, attributed to them in the Scripture; and if he do joyn the authority of the tranſlation to his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will value this reaſon equivalent to both; and then they'l further tell him; 1. That the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do take the word puniſhment in a general ſenſe, as it is applicable to ſtrokes of mercy, as well as of juſtice; and not onely as it is taken for the ſtrokes of wrathfull and vindictive vengeance, which are proper puniſhments out of juſtice from a revenging judge, and to the ſatisfaction of juſtice, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> do take the word. And 2. they'l mind him again of the caſe of the queſtion as it was at firſt ſtated, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is to prove his tenets out of his Lord and Maſters origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal words, as if there were not a tranſlation of them at hand to look on, or elſe he muſt lie under and bear the imputation of an unfit Embaſſadour of his Maſter to his people, in this far at leaſt, (which is very far in my apprehenſion) that he cannot ſo much as read underſtandingly his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters words, but by other mens eyes; and if ſo,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:120067:89"/>
how can he then poſſibly from his own knowledg, beſpeak and declare his Maſters mind to his people? And then they'l conclude, that therefore ſuch wiſe ones muſt ſuffer themſelves to be informed of the original, when they are ſo much miſtaken about it.</p>
                  <p>But now at length wee come to the laſt, and <hi>yet</hi> the groſſeſt of all Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> miſtakes in this point; for I think it is one of the moſt intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly impertinent miſ-applications, that ever a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional diſputant was guilty of, in citing a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to gain authority to any of his opinions; ſo that the truth is, I cannot but bee ſorry, that I am neceſſitated to be ſo pungent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a learned man, as the meer relation of the miſtake muſt needs be; when it is known and taken notice of; yea I ſhould reſolve in ſilence to paſſe it over; were it not thereby to procure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after more ſerious thoughts about the application of Scriptural teſtimonies, to authorize mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and that more diligence may bee uſed for the underſtanding of the original teſtimonies of Scripture, then hitherto hath been; leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes applications be found and proved to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but moſt impertinent miſ-applications, and deceiving illuſions both of others and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who bring ſuch Teſtimonies for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Tenets: for this end I cannot but declare, that Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> miſtake and miſ-appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that one Text of Scripture, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 18. May be enough to frighten a hundred from citing any unknown teſtimony out of Scripture, leſt they both deceive themſelves and others; and give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſome one or other to tell them, that if
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:120067:90"/>
they worſhip not an unknown God, in being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the mind and meaning of God, and not knowing it themſelves by his own words; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by ſo doing, they read their Lectures from the unknown words of the true God; which how dangerous a thing it is, let the ſerious thoughts of ſerious Chriſtians judge; for thereby they read to others what they know not (themſelves) whether it be truth or errour, becauſe they know not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by their own knowledge, whether it be agreeable to the pure original words of truth in the Scripture which they cite, or whether it may not be quite contrary to them, for any thing that they know, or can ſee and diſcern with their own eyes.</p>
                  <p>But that it may clearly appear that this adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement is not given without ground from this miſtake of Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> and his miſapplication of that forementioned Text, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 18. The ſtate of the queſtion is once more to be remembred and mentioned: And it is this, Whether the ſufferings of the godly or their afflictions be proper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being inflicted upon them, and proceeding from God as a Judge, out of vindictive vengeance and revenging wrath, for ſatisfaction of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirmeth, or whether they be only chaſtiſements and corrections proceeding from God our of fatherly love and mercy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his people from their ſins, and to make them ſenſible of their offences, and that God will not altogether hold them guiltleſs, or count or declare them innocent, who do knowingly offend againſt him: This Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Antagoniſts do affirm, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:120067:90"/>
upon this ground, that the Scripture doth never call the afflictions of the godly by the name of proper puniſhments, becauſe ſuch are inflicted for ſatisfaction to juſtice, but nothing but infinite or eternal ſufferings can ſatisfie infinite juſtice; and therefore none but the ſufferings of Chriſt, God as well as man can be equivalent to ſuch a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he hath payed it fully for the godly, and and therefore it cannot be payd, nor juſtly required to be payed again by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Well, but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will undertake to prove the contrary, that the Saints ſufferings are proper puniſhments, &amp;c. and by this argument, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many places doth call them proper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, therefore they are ſo, and are to be called ſo by us: The antecedent is denyed to him, and his Antagoniſts do affirm, that the Scriptures doe not call them ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now he being put to prove his aſſertion, that the Scripture doth call the ſufferings of the Godly proper puniſhments, and not onely Chaſtiſements and Corrections; would it ever enter into any mans imagination, that ſo judiciouſly rational, and learned a man, and ſo ſharp ſighted in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> is; would bring ſuch a Text to prove his point, as <hi>Lev. 21. ver. 21. And I will chaſtiſe (or correct) you ſeven times for your ſins;</hi> would this be a fit Text to prove that God doth not onely correct and chaſtiſe his people for their ſins, but alſo that he doth properly puniſh them; in which there is not a word of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned, but onely of Chaſtiſement and Correction for offences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:120067:91"/>I do verily think that there are many hundreds in <hi>England,</hi> that would averre me a very lyar to my face, if I ſhould onely by word of mouth affirm unto them, that eagle-eyed <hi>Baxter</hi> were ſo far over-ſeen, and ſo ſhort ſighted in proving his points: And therefore I muſt firſt of all tell it now to himſelf, that it is no leſſe then truth, that he is ſo far overſeen, and that his ſight is juſt ſo ſhort, and nothing ſharper in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; for out of that very chapter, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.
